v9 changelog (26/05/05)

 Note : v9 was compiled without -extra in rad to save time. 
Visual quality of the lighting is slightly reduced as a result.

-Extended Core Monitoring closer towards Core, so that the joining corridor is shorter, and so sieging is easier.
-Renamed Coolant Maintenance to Coolant Transfer
-Shifted Coolant Transfer south, to put it closer to core, so that the joining corridor is shorter,
 and so that sieging is easier.
-Widened Cooland Transfer.
-Fixed all vis errors.
-Opened up the Repair Bay/Maintenance Corridors area a bit.
-Opened up Sleeping Area considerably (no more dead ends), and made navigation easier (flat ceiling etc).
-Improved Sleeping Area visually slightly.
-Rerouted Life Support vent from Sleeping Area to N-Turn (experimental).
-Sbend reworked visually.
-Vent exit in Sbend changed to exit out of a small room off of Sbend.
-Added alot more infestation in the hives, I'm not sure if I'm happy with the infestation textures, 
 so they are subject to change. (update) changed them :)
-Added crate at East exit of Marine Start, and moved MS RT slightly east.
-Fixed all the sinking structures problems associated with metal grates (apart from the ones in The Hub,
 as the structures are easily accessible anyway).
-Fixed the bug where you could build structures on the antenae (spikes) outside the Communications window.

-Added a shielded area on the central structure in Core hive, and also lowered the hive.
-Widened the North and South corridor coming off of Core Monitoring.

 add a feature to distinguish them in the next version.
-Deleted the Core Power -> Core Monitoring vent.
-Made the corridor entering Living Area from Life Support less convoluted and deleted the door so it is less
 confusing.
-Some minor r_speed optimisations here and there.
