       curl_easy_setopt - set options for a curl easy handle


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLoption option,
       parameter);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       curl_easy_setopt() is used to tell libcurl how to  behave.
       By  using the appropriate options to <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I>, you
       can change libcurl's behavior.  All options are  set  with
       the  <I>option</I> followed by a <I>parameter</I>. That parameter can be
       a long, a function  pointer  or  an  object  pointer,  all
       depending  on  what the specific option expects. Read this
       manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl  to
       behave  badly!   You can only set one option in each func-
       tion   call.   A    typical    application    uses    many
       curl_easy_setopt() calls in the setup phase.

       <B>NOTE:</B>  strings  passed  to  libcurl as 'char *' arguments,
       will not be copied by the library. Instead you should keep
       them available until libcurl no longer needs them. Failing
       to do so will cause very odd  behavior  or  even  crashes.
       libcurl  will need them until you call curl_easy_cleanup()
       or you set the  same  option  again  to  use  a  different
       pointer.

       <B>NOTE2:</B>  options  set with this function call are valid for
       the forthcoming data transfers that are performed when you
       invoke  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>.  The options are not in any way
       reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent  trans-
       fers  with different options, you must change them between
       the transfers.

       The <I>handle</I> is the return code from a <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>init(3)</I>  or
       <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>duphandle(3)</I> call.


</PRE>
<H2>BEHAVIOR OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_VERBOSE</B>
           Set  the  parameter  to non-zero to get the library to
           display a lot of verbose information about its  opera-
           tions.  Very useful for libcurl and/or protocol debug-
           ging and understanding.

           You hardly ever want this set in production  use,  you
           will  almost  always  want  this when you debug/report
           problems. Another neat option  for  debugging  is  the
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>DEBUGFUNCTION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_HEADER</B>
           A  non-zero parameter tells the library to include the
           data (like HTTP).

       <B>CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to shut of  the
           built-in progress meter completely.

           <B>NOTE:</B> future versions of libcurl is likely to not have
           any built-in progress meter at all.

       <B>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL</B>
           Pass a long. If it is non-zero, libcurl will  not  use
           any  functions  that  install  signal  handlers or any
           functions that cause signals to be sent  to  the  pro-
           cess.  This  option  is  mainly  here  to allow multi-
           threaded unix applications to still set/use all  time-
           out  options  etc,  without  risking  getting signals.

<H2>CALLBACK OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</B>
           Function pointer that should match the following  pro-
           totype:  <B>size_t</B>  <B>function(</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*ptr,</B>  <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
           <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B> <B>void</B> <B>*stream);</B> This function gets called
           by  libcurl  as  soon  as  there is data reveiced that
           needs to be saved. The size of the data pointed to  by
           <I>ptr</I> is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>, it will not be zero
           terminated. Return the number of bytes actually  taken
           care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed
           to your function, it'll signal an error to the library
           and   it   will   abort   the   transfer   and  return
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>.

           Set the <I>stream</I> argument with the <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B>  option.

           <B>NOTE:</B>  you  will be passed as much data as possible in
           all invokes, but you cannot possibly make any  assump-
           tions.  It  may  be one byte, it may be thousands. The
           maximum amount of data that can be passed to the write
           callback   is  defined  in  the  curl.h  header  file:
           CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE.

       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</B>
           Data pointer to pass to the file write function.  Note
           that if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I>, this is
           the pointer you'll get as input. If you  don't  use  a
           callback,  you  must  pass  a 'FILE *' as libcurl will
           pass this to fwrite() when writing data.

           <B>NOTE:</B> If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST
           use  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I> if you set this option
           or you will experience crashes.
           <B>LOPT_FILE</B>,  the  name CURLOPT_WRITEDATA was introduced
           in 7.9.7.

       <B>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION</B>
           Function pointer that should match the following  pro-
           totype:  <B>size_t</B>  <B>function(</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*ptr,</B>  <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
           <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B> <B>void</B> <B>*stream);</B> This function gets called
           by  libcurl  as soon as it needs to read data in order
           to send it to the peer. The data area  pointed  at  by
           the pointer <I>ptr</I> may be filled with at most <I>size</I> multi-
           plied with <I>nmemb</I> number of bytes. Your  function  must
           return  the  actual number of bytes that you stored in
           that memory area. Returning 0 will signal  end-of-file
           to the library and cause it to stop the current trans-
           fer.

       <B>CURLOPT_READDATA</B>
           Data pointer to pass to the file read  function.  Note
           that  if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>, this is
           the pointer you'll get as input. If you don't  specify
           a read callback, this must be a valid FILE *.

           <B>NOTE:</B> If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST
           use a <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I> if you set this option.

           This option is also known with  the  older  name  <B>CUR-</B>
           <B>LOPT_INFILE</B>,  the name CURLOPT_READDATA was introduced
           in 7.9.7.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</B>
           Function    pointer    that    should    match     the
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>progress</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I>      prototype     found     in
           <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I>. This function gets  called  by  libcurl
           instead  of  its  internal  equivalent with a frequent
           interval during data transfer.   Unknown/unused  argu-
           ment  values  will  be  set  to zero (like if you only
           download data, the upload size will remain 0). Return-
           ing  a  non-zero  value  from this callback will cause
           libcurl   to   abort   the   transfer    and    return
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>ABORTED</I><B>_</B><I>BY</I><B>_</B><I>CALLBACK</I>.

           Also note that <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>NOPROGRESS</I> must be set to FALSE
           to make this function actually get called.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA</B>
           Pass a pointer that will be untouched by  libcurl  and
           passed  as the first argument in the progress callback
           set with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROGRESSFUNCTION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION</B>
           Pass a pointer to a <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>passwd</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I> function that
           will  be called instead of the internal one if libcurl
           <B>char*</B> <B>buffer,</B> <B>int</B> <B>buflen</B> <B>);</B>.  If set to NULL, it  sets
           back  the function to the internal default one. If the
           function returns a non-zero value, it will  abort  the
           operation  and  an  error (CURLE_BAD_PASSWORD_ENTERED)
           will be returned.  <I>client</I> is a  generic  pointer,  see
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDDATA</I>.    <I>prompt</I>   is  a  zero-terminated
           string that is text that prefixes the  input  request.
           <I>buffer</I> is a pointer to data where the entered password
           should be stored and <I>buflen</I> is the maximum  number  of
           bytes  that  may  be written in the buffer.  (Added in
           7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA</B>
           Pass a void * to whatever data you  want.  The  passed
           pointer  will  be  the  first  argument  sent  to  the
           specifed <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I>  function.  (Added  in
           7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION</B>
           Function  pointer that should match the following pro-
           totype:  <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>function(</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*ptr,</I>  <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>size,</I>
           <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>nmemb,</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*stream);</I>.  This  function  gets
           called by libcurl as soon as there is received  header
           data  that  needs  to be written down. The headers are
           guaranteed to be written one-by-one and only  complete
           lines  are  written.  Parsing  headers  should be easy
           enough using this. The size of the data pointed to  by
           <I>ptr</I>  is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>.  The pointer named
           <I>stream</I> will be the one you passed to libcurl with  the
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEHEADER</I>  option.   Return  the  number  of
           bytes actually written or return -1 to signal error to
           the  library  (it  will cause it to abort the transfer
           with  a  <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>  return  code).  (Added  in
           7.7.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</B>
           Pass  a pointer to be used to write the header part of
           the received data to. If you don't use your own  call-
           back to take care of the writing, this must be a valid
           FILE *. See  also  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HEADERFUNCTION</I>  option
           above on how to set a custom get-all-headers callback.

       <B>CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION</B>
           Function pointer that should match the following  pro-
           totype:  <I>int</I>  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>debug</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I>  <I>(CURL</I> <I>*,</I> <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>info-</I>
           <I>type,</I> <I>char</I> <I>*,</I> <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t,</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*);</I>  This  function  will
           receive   debug   information  if  CURLOPT_VERBOSE  is
           enabled. The  curl_infotype  argument  specifies  what
           kind of information it is. This funtion must return 0.

           NOTE: the data pointed to by the char * passed to this
           function  WILL  NOT  be  zero  terminated, but will be
           Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed in to  your
           CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION  in  the  last  void * argument.
           This pointer is not used by libcurl, it is only passed
           to the callback.



</PRE>
<H2>ERROR OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER</B>
           Pass  a  char * to a buffer that the libcurl may store
           human readable error messages in.  This  may  be  more
           helpful  than  just  the return code from the library.
           The buffer must be at least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.

           Use <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>VERBOSE</I> and <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>DEBUGFUNCTION</I> to  bet-
           ter debug/trace why errors happen.

           <B>Note:</B>  if  the  library  does not return an error, the
           buffer may not have been touched. Do not rely  on  the
           contents in those cases.

       <B>CURLOPT_STDERR</B>
           Pass  a FILE * as parameter. This is the stream to use
           instead of stderr internally when reporting errors.

       <B>CURLOPT_FAILONERROR</B>
           A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to   fail
           silently  if  the  HTTP  code  returned is equal to or
           larger than 300. The default action would be to return
           the page normally, ignoring that code.



</PRE>
<H2>NETWORK OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_URL</B>
           The actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be a
           char * to a zero terminated string.  The  string  must
           remain  present  until  curl no longer needs it, as it
           doesn't copy the string.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this option is (the only one) required to be set
           before <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform(3)</I> is called.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXY</B>
           Set  HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a char
           * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or
           dotted  IP  address.  To  specify  port number in this
           string, append :[port] to the end of  the  host  name.
           The  proxy  string  may be prefixed with [protocol]://
           since any such prefix will  be  ignored.  The  proxy's
           port number may optionally be specified with the sepa-
           rate option <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXYPORT</I>.

           <B>NOTE:</B> when you tell the library to use a  HTTP  proxy,
           impact  on  what other features of the library you can
           use, such as CURLOPT_QUOTE and similar  FTP  specifics
           that  don't  work  unless  you tunnel through the HTTP
           proxy. Such tunneling is activated with  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTP-</I>
           <I>PROXYTUNNEL</I>.

           <B>NOTE2:</B>  libcurl  respects  the  environment  variables
           <B>http_proxy</B>, <B>ftp_proxy</B>, <B>all_proxy</B> etc, if any of  those
           is set.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYPORT</B>
           Pass  a long with this option to set the proxy port to
           connect to unless it is specified in the proxy  string
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXY</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE</B>
           Pass a long with this option to set type of the proxy.
           Available options  for  this  are  CURLPROXY_HTTP  and
           CURLPROXY_SOCKS5,  with  the  HTTP  one being default.
           (Added in 7.10)

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</B>
           Set the parameter to non-zero to get  the  library  to
           tunnel all operations through a given HTTP proxy. Note
           that there is a big difference between using  a  proxy
           and  to tunnel through it. If you don't know what this
           means, you probably don't want this tunneling  option.
           (Added in 7.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_INTERFACE</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  as parameter. This set the interface
           name to use as outgoing network  interface.  The  name
           can  be  an  interface  name,  an IP address or a host
           name. (Added in 7.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT</B>
           Pass a long, this sets the timeout  in  seconds.  Name
           resolves  will  be  kept  in memory for this number of
           seconds.  Set  to  zero  (0)  to  completely   disable
           caching,  or  set  to  -1  to  make the cached entries
           remain forever. By default, libcurl caches info for 60
           seconds. (Added in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE</B>
           Pass  a  long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl
           to use a global DNS cache that  will  survive  between
           easy  handle  creations  and  deletions.  This  is not
           thread-safe and this will use a global varible. (Added
           in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE</B>
           Pass  a  long  specifying  your  prefered size for the
           often and with smaller chunks. This is just treated as
           a  request,  not an order. You cannot be guaranteed to
           actually get the given size. (Added in 7.10)



</PRE>
<H2>NAMES and PASSWORDS OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_NETRC</B>
           This parameter  controls  the  preference  of  libcurl
           between  using  user  names  and  passwords  from your
           <I>~/.netrc</I> file, relative to user names and passwords in
           the URL supplied with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>URL</I>.

           <B>Note:</B>  libcurl  uses  a  user  name  (and  supplied or
           prompted password) supplied  with  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>USERPWD</I>  in
           preference  to  any  of the options controlled by this
           parameter.

           Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL</B>
                The  use  of  your <I>~/.netrc</I> file is optional, and
                information in the URL is to be  preferred.   The
                file  will be scanned with the host and user name
                (to find the password  only)  or  with  the  host
                only,  to  find  the first user name and password
                after that <I>machine</I>, which ever information is not
                specified in the URL.

                Undefined  values  of  the  option will have this
                effect.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_IGNORED</B>
                The library will ignore the file and use only the
                information in the URL.

                This is the default.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED</B>
                This value tells the library that use of the file
                is required, to ignore  the  information  in  the
                URL, and to search the file with the host only.

       Only machine name, user name and password are taken into
           account
           (init macros and similar things aren't supported).

           <B>Note:</B> libcurl does not verify that the  file  has  the
           correct  properties  set  (as  the  standard  Unix ftp
           client does). It should only be readable by user.

       <B>CURLOPT_USERPWD</B>
           Pass a char * as  parameter,  which  should  be  [user
           prompted  for  it while using a colon with no password
           will make libcurl use an empty password. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASS-</I>
           <I>WDFUNCTION</I>  can  be  used to set your own prompt func-
           tion.

           When using HTTP  and  CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,  libcurl
           might  perform  several requests to possibly different
           hosts. libcurl will only send this user  and  password
           information  to  hosts using the initial host name, so
           if libcurl follows locations to other  hosts  it  will
           not  send  the  user  and  password  to those. This is
           enforced to prevent accidental information leakage.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD</B>
           Pass a char * as  parameter,  which  should  be  [user
           name]:[password] to use for the connection to the HTTP
           proxy. If the  password  is  left  out,  you  will  be
           prompted for it. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be used to
           set your own prompt function.

<H2>HTTP OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_ENCODING</B>
           Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header  sent
           in an HTTP request, and enables decoding of a response
           when a Content-Encoding: header  is  received.   Three
           encodings are supported: <I>identity</I>, which does nothing,
           <I>deflate</I> which requests  the  server  to  compress  its
           response  using  the  zlib  algorithm,  and <I>gzip</I> which
           requests the gzip algorithm.  If a zero-length  string
           is set, then an Accept-Encoding: header containing all
           supported encodings is sent.

           This is a request, not an order; the server may or may
           not  do  it.  This option must be set (to any non-NULL
           value) or else any unsolicited encoding  done  by  the
           server    is    ignored.    See   the   special   file
           lib/README.encoding for details.

       <B>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to  follow  any
           Location:  header  that  the server sends as part of a
           HTTP header.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this means that the  library  will  re-send  the
           same  request on the new location and follow new Loca-
           tion: headers all the way until no more  such  headers
           are  returned.  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>MAXREDIRS</I> can be used to limit
           the number of redirects libcurl will follow.

       <B>CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library it can continue
           is  meaningful  only  when setting <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>FOLLOWLOCA-</I>
           <I>TION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS</B>
           Pass a long. The set number will  be  the  redirection
           limit.  If  that many redirections have been followed,
           the   next    redirect    will    cause    an    error
           (<I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>TOO</I><B>_</B><I>MANY</I><B>_</B><I>REDIRECTS</I>).  This  option  only  makes
           sense if the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>FOLLOWLOCATION</I>  is  used  at  the
           same time. (Added in 7.5)

       <B>CURLOPT_PUT</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to use HTTP PUT
           to transfer data. The data should  be  set  with  CUR-
           LOPT_READDATA and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE.

       <B>CURLOPT_POST</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to do a regular
           HTTP post. This is  a  normal  application/x-www-form-
           urlencoded  kind,  which is the most commonly used one
           by HTML forms. See the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS  option  for
           how to specify the data to post and CURLOPT_POSTFIELD-
           SIZE in how  to  set  the  data  size.  Starting  with
           libcurl  7.8,  this option is obsolete. Using the CUR-
           LOPT_POSTFIELDS option will imply this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</B>
           Pass a char * as parameter, which should be  the  full
           data  to  post  in  a HTTP post operation. You need to
           make sure that the data is formatted the way you  want
           the  server to receive it. libcurl will not convert or
           encode it for you. Most web servers will  assume  this
           data to be url-encoded. Take note.

           This  POST  is  a normal application/x-www-form-urlen-
           coded kind (and libcurl will set that Content-Type  by
           default  when  this option is used), which is the most
           commonly used one by HTML forms.  See  also  the  CUR-
           LOPT_POST.   Using   CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS  implies  CUR-
           LOPT_POST.

           <B>Note:</B>   to   make   multipart/formdata   posts    (aka
           rfc1867-posts), check out the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPPOST</I> option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</B>
           If you want to post data to the server without letting
           libcurl  do  a strlen() to measure the data size, this
           option must be used. When this option is used you  can
           post  fully  binary data, which otherwise is likely to
           fail. If this size is set to zero,  the  library  will
           use strlen() to get the size. (Added in libcurl 7.2)

           Tells  libcurl you want a multipart/formdata HTTP POST
           to be made and you instruct what data to  pass  on  to
           the  server.   Pass a pointer to a linked list of HTTP
           post structs as parameter.  The linked list should  be
           a  fully valid list of 'struct HttpPost' structs prop-
           erly filled in. The best and most elegant  way  to  do
           this,  is  to  use  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>formadd(3)</I> as documented. The
           data in this list must remain intact until  you  close
           this curl handle again with <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_REFERER</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used to set the Referer: header in the
           http  request  sent  to the remote server. This can be
           used to fool servers or scripts. You can also set  any
           custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_USERAGENT</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used to set the User-Agent: header  in
           the  http  request sent to the remote server. This can
           be used to fool servers or scripts. You can  also  set
           any custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</B>
           Pass  a  pointer  to  a linked list of HTTP headers to
           pass to the server in your HTTP  request.  The  linked
           list should be a fully valid list of <B>struct</B> <B>curl_slist</B>
           structs properly filled in.  Use  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I>
           to create the list and <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I> to clean
           up an entire list. If you add a header that is  other-
           wise  generated  and  used by libcurl internally, your
           added one will be used instead. If you  add  a  header
           with no contents as in 'Accept:' (no data on the right
           side of the colon), the internally  used  header  will
           get  disabled. Thus, using this option you can add new
           headers, replace internal headers and remove  internal
           headers.  The headers included in the linked list must
           not be CRLF-terminated, because curl adds  CRLF  after
           each  header  item.  Failure  to comply with this will
           result in strange bugs because the  server  will  most
           likely ignore part of the headers you specified.

           <B>NOTE:</B>The  most  commonly replaced headers have "short-
           cuts" in the options CURLOPT_COOKIE, CURLOPT_USERAGENT
           and CURLOPT_REFERER.

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES</B>
           Pass  a  pointer  to  a  linked  list of aliases to be
           treated as valid HTTP  200  responses.   Some  servers
           respond with a custom header response line.  For exam-
           ple, IceCast servers respond with "ICY  200  OK".   By
           such as "HTTP/1.0 200 OK". (Added in 7.10.3)

           The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct
           curl_slist structs, and be properly  filled  in.   Use
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I>    to   create   the   list   and
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I> to clean up an entire list.

           <B>NOTE:</B>The alias itself is not parsed  for  any  version
           strings.   So  if  your alias is "MYHTTP/9.9", Libcurl
           will not treat the server as responding with HTTP ver-
           sion  9.9.   Instead Libcurl will use the value set by
           option <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTP</I><B>_</B><I>VERSION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It  will  be  used  to  set a cookie in the http
           request. The format of the string should be  NAME=CON-
           TENTS,  where  NAME is the cookie name and CONTENTS is
           what the cookie should contain.

           If you need to set mulitple cookies, you need  to  set
           them  all  using  a single option and thus you need to
           concat them all in one  single  string.  Set  multiple
           cookies  in  one  string  like  this: "name1=content1;
           name2=content2;" etc.

           Using this option multiple times will  only  make  the
           latest string override the previously ones.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It should contain the name of your  file  holding
           cookie  data  to  read.  The  cookie  data  may  be in
           Netscape / Mozilla cookie data format or just  regular
           HTTP-style headers dumped to a file.

           Given  an empty or non-existing file, this option will
           enable cookies for this curl handle, making it  under-
           stand and parse received cookies and then use matching
           cookies in future request.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR</B>
           Pass a file name as char *, zero terminated. This will
           make libcurl write all internally known cookies to the
           specified file when <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I> is called. If
           no cookies are known, no file will be created. Specify
           "-" to instead have the  cookies  written  to  stdout.
           Using  this  option also enables cookies for this ses-
           sion, so if you for example follow a location it  will
           make  matching cookies get sent accordingly. (Added in
           7.9)

           libcurl will not and cannot report an error for  this.
           Using  CURLOPT_VERBOSE  or  CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION will
           get a warning to display, but that is the only visible
           feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

       <B>CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. This defines  how  the  CUR-
           LOPT_TIMEVALUE time value is treated. You can set this
           parameter  to  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  or  TIMECOND_IFUN-
           MODSINCE. This is a HTTP-only feature. (TBD)

       <B>CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE</B>
           Pass  a  long as parameter. This should be the time in
           seconds since 1 jan 1970, and the time will be used in
           a condition as specified with CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION.

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPGET</B>
           Pass  a long. If the long is non-zero, this forces the
           HTTP request to get back to GET. Only really usable if
           POST,  PUT  or  a custom request have been used previ-
           ously using the same curl handle. (Added in 7.8.1)

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION</B>
           Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.
           They  force libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions.
           This is not sensible to do unless you have a good rea-
           son.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE</B>
                We  don't  care  about  what  version the library
                uses. libcurl will use whatever it thinks fit.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0</B>
                Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1</B>
                Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.



</PRE>
<H2>FTP OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_FTPPORT</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It will be used to get the IP address to use for
           the ftp PORT instruction. The PORT  instruction  tells
           the  remote  server  to  connect  to  our specified IP
           address. The string may be a plain IP address, a  host
           name, an network interface name (under Unix) or just a
           '-' letter to let the library use your systems default
           IP  address.  Default  FTP operations are passive, and
           thus won't use PORT.

           You disable PORT again and go back to using  the  pas-
           Pass  a  pointer  to  a linked list of FTP commands to
           pass to the server prior to  your  ftp  request.  This
           will  be done before any other FTP commands are issued
           (even before the CWD command). The linked list  should
           be  a fully valid list of to append strings (commands)
           to the list, and clear the entire list afterwards with
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I>.  Disable  this operation again
           by setting a NULL to this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a linked list  of  FTP  commands  to
           pass  to  the  server after your ftp transfer request.
           The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct
           curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>. Disable this operation again by setting
           a NULL to this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_PREQUOTE</B>
           Pass  a  pointer  to  a linked list of FTP commands to
           pass to the server after the transfer type is set. The
           linked  list  should  be  a fully valid list of struct
           curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>. Disable this operation again by setting
           a NULL to this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library  to  just  list
           the names of an ftp directory, instead of doing a full
           directory listing that would include file sizes, dates
           etc.

           This  causes  an  FTP NLST command to be sent.  Beware
           that  some  FTP  servers  list  only  files  in  their
           response  to  NLST; they might not include subdirecto-
           ries and symbolic links.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library  to  append  to
           the  remote file instead of overwrite it. This is only
           useful when uploading to a ftp site.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT</B>
           Pass a long. If the value is non-zero, it  tells  curl
           to  use  the EPRT (and LPRT) command when doing active
           FTP downloads (which is enabled  by  CURLOPT_FTPPORT).
           Using  EPRT  means  that  it will first attempt to use
           EPRT and then LPRT before using PORT, but if you  pass
           FALSE  (zero)  to  this  option, it will not try using
           EPRT or LPRT, only plain PORT. (Added in 7.10.5)

       <B>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV</B>
           Pass a long. If the value is non-zero, it  tells  curl
           EPSV  means  that  it  will  first attempt to use EPSV
           before using PASV, but if you  pass  FALSE  (zero)  to
           this  option,  it  will not try using EPSV, only plain
           PASV.



</PRE>
<H2>PROTOCOL OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library  to  use  ASCII
           mode  for ftp transfers, instead of the default binary
           transfer. For LDAP transfers it gets the data in plain
           text instead of HTML and for win32 systems it does not
           set the stdout to binary  mode.  This  option  can  be
           usable  when  transferring  text  data between systems
           with different views on certain  characters,  such  as
           newlines or similar.

       <B>CURLOPT_CRLF</B>
           Convert Unix newlines to CRLF newlines on transfers.

       <B>CURLOPT_RANGE</B>
           Pass  a  char * as parameter, which should contain the
           specified range you want. It should be in  the  format
           "X-Y",  where  X  or Y may be left out. HTTP transfers
           also support several intervals, separated with  commas
           as in <I>"X-Y,N-M"</I>. Using this kind of multiple intervals
           will cause the HTTP server to send the response  docu-
           ment  in  pieces (using standard MIME separation tech-
           niques).

       <B>CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. It contains  the  offset  in
           number  of  bytes  that you want the transfer to start
           from.

       <B>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter. It will be user instead of GET or HEAD when doing
           the HTTP request. This is useful for doing  DELETE  or
           other  more  or  less  obscure HTTP requests. Don't do
           this at will, make sure your server supports the  com-
           mand first.

       <B>CURLOPT_FILETIME</B>
           Pass  a  long. If it is a non-zero value, libcurl will
           attempt to get the modification  date  of  the  remote
           document  in  this  operation.  This requires that the
           remote server sends the time  or  replies  to  a  time
           querying  command.  The  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>getinfo(3)</I> function
           with the <I>CURLINFO</I><B>_</B><I>FILETIME</I> argument can be used  after
           a  transfer  to  extract  the  received time (if any).
           (Added in 7.5)
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to not  include
           the body-part in the output. This is only relevant for
           protocols that have separate header and body parts.

       <B>CURLOPT_INFILESIZE</B>
           When uploading a file to a remote  site,  this  option
           should  be used to tell libcurl what the expected size
           of the infile is.

       <B>CURLOPT_UPLOAD</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to prepare  for
           an upload. The CURLOPT_READDATA and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE
           are also interesting for uploads.

<H2>CONNECTION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT</B>
           Pass a long as parameter containing the  maximum  time
           in  seconds that you allow the libcurl transfer opera-
           tion to take. Normally, name lookups can take  a  con-
           siderable  time and limiting operations to less than a
           few minutes risk aborting perfectly normal operations.
           This  option  will  cause  curl  to use the SIGALRM to
           enable time-outing system calls.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this is not recommended to use  in  unix  multi-
           threaded  programs,  as  it  uses  signals unless CUR-
           LOPT_NOSIGNAL (see above) is set.

       <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</B>
           Pass a long as parameter.  It  contains  the  transfer
           speed  in bytes per second that the transfer should be
           below during CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME  seconds  for  the
           library to consider it too slow and abort.

       <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in sec-
           onds that  the  transfer  should  be  below  the  CUR-
           LOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT  for  the  library to consider it
           too slow and abort.

       <B>CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS</B>
           Pass a long. The set number  will  be  the  persistent
           connection cache size. The set amount will be the max-
           imum amount of simultaneously  open  connections  that
           libcurl  may cache. Default is 5, and there isn't much
           point in changing this value unless you are  perfectly
           aware   of   how   this  work  and  changes  libcurl's
           behaviour. This concerns connection using any  of  the
           protocols that support persistent connections.

           When  reaching  the  maximum limit, curl uses the <I>CUR-</I>
           connections to increase.

           <B>NOTE:</B> if you already  have  performed  transfers  with
           this  curl  handle, setting a smaller MAXCONNECTS than
           before may cause open connections to get closed unnec-
           essarily. (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY</B>
           Pass  a  long.  This  option  sets what policy libcurl
           should use when the connection cache is filled and one
           of  the open connections has to be closed to make room
           for a new connection. This must be one  of  the  CURL-
           CLOSEPOLICY_*      defines.      Use     <I>CURLCLOSEPOL-</I>
           <I>ICY</I><B>_</B><I>LEAST</I><B>_</B><I>RECENTLY</I><B>_</B><I>USED</I> to make libcurl close the con-
           nection  that was least recently used, that connection
           is also least likely to  be  capable  of  re-use.  Use
           <I>CURLCLOSEPOLICY</I><B>_</B><I>OLDEST</I>  to make libcurl close the old-
           est connection, the one that was created  first  among
           the  ones  in  the  connection  cache. The other close
           policies are not support yet. (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT</B>
           Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer
           use  a new (fresh) connection by force. If the connec-
           tion cache is full before this connection, one of  the
           existing  connections  will  be closed as according to
           the selected or default policy. This option should  be
           used  with  caution and only if you understand what it
           does. Set this to 0 to have libcurl  attempt  re-using
           an  existing connection (default behavior).  (Added in
           7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE</B>
           Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer
           explicitly  close  the connection when done. Normally,
           libcurl keep all connections alive when done with  one
           transfer in case there comes a succeeding one that can
           re-use them.  This option should be used with  caution
           and  only  if you understand what it does. Set to 0 to
           have libcurl keep the  connection  open  for  possibly
           later re-use (default behavior). (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT</B>
           Pass  a  long.  It  should contain the maximum time in
           seconds that you allow the connection to the server to
           take.   This only limits the connection phase, once it
           has connected, this option is of no more use.  Set  to
           zero  to disable connection timeout (it will then only
           timeout on the system's internal timeouts).  See  also
           the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I> option.

           <B>NOTE:</B>  this  is  not recommended to use in unix multi-

<H2>SSL and SECURITY OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERT</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. The string should be the file name of  your  cer-
           tificate.  The  default  format  is  "PEM"  and can be
           changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLCERTTYPE</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  The string should be the format of your certifi-
           cate. Supported formats are "PEM" and  "DER".   (Added
           in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTPASSWD</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used as the password required  to  use
           the  CURLOPT_SSLCERT  certificate.  If the password is
           not supplied,  you  will  be  prompted  for  it.  <I>CUR-</I>
           <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be used to set your own prompt
           function.

           <B>NOTE:</B>This option is replaced  by  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYPASSWD</I>
           and  only  cept  for backward compatibility. You never
           needed a pass phrase to load  a  certificate  but  you
           need one to load your private key.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEY</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. The string should be the file name of  your  pri-
           vate  key.  The  default  format  is  "PEM" and can be
           changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYTYPE</I>. (Added in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  The  string should be the format of your private
           key. Supported formats are  "PEM",  "DER"  and  "ENG".
           (Added in 7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>The  format "ENG" enables you to load the private
           key from a crypto engine. in this case  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I>
           is  used  as  an  identifier passed to the engine. You
           have to set the crypto engine with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used as the password required  to  use
           the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I> private key. If the password is not
           supplied, you will be prompted for it. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWD-</I>
           <I>FUNCTION</I>  can be used to set your own prompt function.
           (Added in 7.9.3)
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It will be used as the identifier for the crypto
           engine you want to use for your private key. (Added in
           7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>If   the   crypto   device   cannot   be  loaded,
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>NOTFOUND</I> is returned.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_ENGINEDEFAULT</B>
           Sets the actual crypto engine as the default for (asy-
           metric) crypto operations. (Added in 7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>If    the    crypto   device   cannot   be   set,
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>SETFAILED</I> is returned.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. Set what version of  SSL  to
           attempt  to  use,  2 or 3. By default, the SSL library
           will try to solve this by itself although some servers
           make  this  difficult why you at times may have to use
           this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</B>
           Pass a long that is set to a zero value to  stop  curl
           from  verifying  the peer's certificate (7.10 starting
           setting this option to TRUE  by  default).   Alternate
           certificates  to  verify against can be specified with
           the CURLOPT_CAINFO option (Added in 7.4.2) or  a  cer-
           tificate  directory  can  be  specified  with the CUR-
           LOPT_CAPATH option (Added in 7.9.8).  As of 7.10, curl
           installs a default bundle.  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST may
           also need to be set to 1  or  0  if  CURLOPT_SSL_VERI-
           FYPEER is disabled (it defaults to 2).

       <B>CURLOPT_CAINFO</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  to a zero terminated string naming a
           file holding one or more certificates  to  verify  the
           peer with. This only makes sense when used in combina-
           tion with the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. (Added in
           7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_CAPATH</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  to a zero terminated string naming a
           directory holding multiple CA certificates  to  verify
           the  peer with. The certificate directory must be pre-
           pared using the openssl c_rehash  utility.  This  only
           makes  sense  when  used  in combination with the CUR-
           LOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. The CAPATH function appar-
           ently  does not work in Windows due to some limitation
           in openssl. (Added in 7.9.8)

       <B>CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE</B>
           for SSL. The more random the specified  file  is,  the
           more secure the SSL connection will become.

       <B>CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET</B>
           Pass  a char * to the zero terminated path name to the
           Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will  be  used  to
           seed the random engine for SSL.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</B>
           Pass  a  long. Set if we should verify the Common name
           from the peer certificate in the SSL handshake, set  1
           to  check  existence,  2 to ensure that it matches the
           provided hostname. This is by default set to 2. (Added
           in 7.8.1, default changed in 7.10)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</B>
           Pass  a  char  *, pointing to a zero terminated string
           holding the list of ciphers to use for the SSL connec-
           tion.  The list must be syntactly correct, it consists
           of one or more cipher  strings  separated  by  colons.
           Commas  or  spaces  are also acceptable separators but
           colons are normally used, , - and +  can  be  used  as
           operators.  Valid  examples  of  cipher  lists include
           'RC4-SHA',  'SHA1+DES',  'TLSv1'  and  'DEFAULT'.  The
           default list is normally set when you compile OpenSSL.

           You'll find more details about cipher  lists  on  this
           URL: <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>

       <B>CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  as  parameter. Set the krb4 security
           level, this also enables krb4 awareness.   This  is  a
           string,  'clear', 'safe', 'confidential' or 'private'.
           If the string is set but doesn't match one  of  these,
           'private' will be used. Set the string to NULL to dis-
           able kerberos4. The kerberos support  only  works  for
           FTP. (Added in 7.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_PRIVATE</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  as  parameter, pointing to data that
           should  be  associated  with  the  curl  handle.   The
           pointer   can  be  subsequently  retrieved  using  the
           CURLINFO_PRIVATE options to curl_easy_getinfo.  (Added
