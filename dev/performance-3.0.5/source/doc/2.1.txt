What's left for 2.1
-------------------

Steam support
-------------
	O Fixed ex_maxerrordistance
	O Added new dummy sprites
	O Debugging environment
	O media\gamestartup.mp3
	O Overflow issues
	O Could not load tech0s.spr over and over
	O New background
	
	- ESC while commanding

	- Pop-up menu corruption (not the connector sprite)
		O Alfred is looking into this
		- Corrupted fonts (http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?s=49a95b2b5ced1b68c86341f6b632a946&act=ST&f=19&t=48042&st=15)

	- Experience sprite and cursor not drawing properly
		? Talk to Max and Alfred

	O Players go through players and hives

	- Crosshair still visible when pop-up menu is open (reported on Mantis)

	- Host_Error: UserMsg: Not Present on Client 57 (dropped all players in middle of game)
		? Added network debug data to build
		- Reported on Mantis

	O WONids to SteamIDs
		- Use WON id
		- If it returns -1, use SteamID
		- Returns "BOT" for fake clients
		- There may be a delay before SteamID is available on connect
		- LAN play returns STEAM_ID_PENDING
		- Local player returns STEAM_ID_LOOPBACK

	O Added ready room option below disconnect (and moved it off the pop-up menu)
		O Ask hlcoder list
		O Reworked pop-up menus to remove ready room option

O Updated all Combat maps and minimaps, and removed HLTV overview files
O Try mapping local build directory drive to avoid @ errors
O Update titles.txt and translations for Nem
	? Write and debug script
O Manual automation update!  Now manual can be updated from Balance.txt automagically.
O Added in security, so players will get kicked off server if they aren't authorized
- Update docs to explain that mp_gametime sets the match time in tourny mode and the time after which the aliens win in Combat.  If running iron man, use mp_ironmantime (recommended at 5).
- Quick guide
	? Wrote XP-Cagey, wait for 1st draft
	? Got first draft, sent feedback
	- Think about adding Perl statement tags to process data (eg, Combat experience table and percentages)

Combat
------
O Reworked resupply, scan and distress beacon to be automatic.  They are cued by the "commander" when you're low in health or ammo, when there's a cloaked alien in view, or when a large portion of your team is dead.
? Don't allow sayings to be spammed (bug #8)
O New level up sound (thanks MadMaxx)
- IMPORTANT: Add game goal tooltips or messages so new players won't be confused the first time it transitions into a new mode

- Client crash?

General bugs
------------
O Fix dropping hives

	<pandas|RoQ> Aliens need Hive, 2 fades, 4 forges, 3 res towers, 3 D's, that adds up to 255 res
	<pandas|RoQ> For us to compete against that on marines... we need....
	<Flayra|NS-Steam> I'm talking to churro right now about this
	<pandas|RoQ> 4 res, 1 ip, 1 armoury, 1 upgraded armoury, arms lab, 2/1, proto, jp, 4 jp's, 4 shotguns
	<pandas|RoQ> 435 res

General features
----------------
O New spectator UI (thanks Max!)
	O This new UI is more simple, informative and easier to use then the old UI.  HLTV overviews have been discarded completely, and they are no longer needed at all.  They have been replaced the NS minimap.  The UI should be especially for great for referees and commentators, as access to the entire map is granted, along with display of all structures.  It is also easy to jump to a single player's view.
	O Publish screenshots
	- Fix PIP rendering
		? Fixed scaling of all but health/armor and overview
	- Verify behavior with 0 players

O New scoring system

		O Show current level/rank of player you're spectating (it was showing your local level/rank)
		O Killing a hive means instant-win now.  Aliens can't lose any other way.  Marines can still lose if all players are dead.

	v2.1c?
	------
	- After second PT
		- <[ReD]Lego> Anyway what i was saying is, right at end of round on alien if you evolve. You stay in game i guess like a spectator bug.

		? Decide on initial level to spend or not (removed)
		O Mines now give credit to owner on kill (also give res on regular NS)
		O Display correct death icon when killing with mines
		O Fixed pre-game jittering
		O Extra experience is now given out when there are more players in range of a kill.

			X - Unoptimized geometry
			X - Hive area to be re-structured to a human manufactured/infested area
			X - Minimap seems broken
			X - Map sucks
			X - No major landmarks (to be remedied by implementing more structure in place of rock/dirt)

	v2.1f
	-----
	- After fifth PT
		O mapcycle.txt now specifies number of players for each map type, so servers automatically switch between Combat and NS (14 max for Combat, 12 player min for NS)
		O Added min/max player defaults to mapcycle.txt.  When the timelimit is hit, the map/gamemode chosen next will depend on the # of players on the server.

		O Increased wave spawn time slightly to lessen stomp/shotgun camping annoyance, and to promote spawning in waves (10 to 12 seconds)

		O Show health on HUD while gestating
		O Added new NS map for playtesting (ns_metal, by quazilin).  This thing looks fantastic.
		O Added alert for marines when their CC is under attack (this change takes effect in regular NS mode as well)

		O Remember spectator settings fully
		O Fixed problem where numents and entityinfo weren't printing info properly (worked for debug code, but not in released NS)
		? Changed iron man variation
			O Same experience curve, but only life per game
			X Can spectate both sides
			? set mp_ironmantime to minutes after which, aliens win

		O Only show hive health friendly players
		O Distress beacon now respawns friendly alive players back at base as well (could be abuseable, but I think it's worth the risk)
		O Pheromones replaced with "Enhanced Hearing".  This upgrade allows aliens to "listen" to nearby enemy build/drop/research messages (level 1 = 500, level 2 = 700, level 3 = 900).
		X Occasional respawning problem from ElvenThief
		O Fixed live particle editing (bug #39).  Also fixed annoying problem where toggling the edit PS screen jarred your view.
		O Fixed siege targetting, and turrets targetting structures

		O Fixed bug where Lerk didn't require Gorge first in Combat 
		O Fixed problem where light damage showed blinking O on HUD
		O Added ability for servers to add custom icons for members (mp_customicon of "AAAARGB" where the custom icon is gfx/vgui/640_AAAA.tga, using color components RGB (each are 0-9).  Use player authentication mask is 512.)

		O Fixed problem where marine upgrades weren't being drawn in NS mode
		O Fixed problem where mines could be stacked (bug #34).  They are now solid, with the following ramifications:
			O They can be stacked on each other, but it is immediately obvious.  A stack of mines now looks like a stack of mines.
			O Mines are can be stood upon.
			O Mines can be killed by regular projectiles, including parasites and friendly fire.  Mines have 30 health.
		- Fonts
			- Corruption
				? Build notifications
				? Occasional missing first upper-case character in location, and autohelp on right (alien only?)
				- Popup menu and your "rank" that appears when you go up a level are still corrupted, but will be fixed with a Steam update next week
			- Reduce 1024x768 font size (CC help text interferes with location as marine)
			- Missing bitmap font: gfx\vgui\fonts\640_OverwatchScheme.tga
		O Showing enemy names shouldn't work on cloaked players (bug #32)
		? Recycling TF/Siege problems (recycling a TF while nearby turrets were recycling prevents turrets from ever finishing recycle)

		O Don't draw motion-tracking circles for soldiers any more (just blips on their map)
		O Turrets now animate smoothly (bug #41)

		O Fixed bug where players gestating on entities could sometimes fall through them

	2.1i
	----
		O New levelup sound (supposed to be a rush of energy)
		O Fixed all hitbox issues (Max, you da man!).  This should fix the problems where players crouching behind structures could become harder to hit ("Crouching Skulk, Hidden Damage").  Bug #84.
		O HLTV/model problems, where sometimes the wrong model would be drawn
		O Manual script should allow division or multiplication by a number
		O Don't scan or resupply in Combat while being digested (bug #69)
		O New game_menu NS logo from Def One
		O Fixed bug where typing "kill" as commander meant you were unkillable even after killing CC (bug #74)

			* More particle effects
			* More ambience sounds
			* Bug fixes
			* Fixed ladder bug (thanks Ekaj)
			* More vents/hiding places
		O New map for playtesting: ns_agora_beta3.  Please give feedback in BI forum, I'll e-mail to the mapper ("kawaak").
		O Fixed: Siege cannons no longer fire on "detected" targets, only on visible targets
		? Addressed "57" bug by not messaging players when a player is booted for not being authorized (not sure if this is the problem, but it seems reasonable)
		O Siege cannons no longer fire on "detected" targets, they must be visible.
		O Removed entity "detection" when near players and moving.  While originally used to allow the commander to detect threats before players can see them, it no longer works with the minimap.
		X Decide whether to recompile all maps for Onos/respawn change or not
		O Removed automatic detection of moving players in Combat mode (just affects minimap)
		O Updated co_core minimap because it was out of date
		O Moved both mines and the welder to slot 4.  This means you can hold your pistol along with one of them.  However, you still can't have both mines and a welder.
		O Removed debug code that spawned player as Onos
		O Fixed bug where typing "kill" as commander meant you were unkillable even after killing CC (bug #74)
		O Fixed Command station not ejecting the commander on death (introduced with mapper-placed structures)
		O Added missing sound for aliens getting resources
		O Put back in knockback for bite, claws, gore and swipe (it affects balance too much to remove without careful testing)
		O Fixed tech tree dependency problems (bug #37)
		O Cloaked players are barely decloaked when touched (bug #59)
		O Fixed bug where players were uncloaking without fading in smoothly
		O Don't allow mines to be placed func_doors, func_door_rotatings, or 3rd-party entities (bug #64)
		O Fixed "cannot click 'need' icons in commander mode" (bug #73)
		O Removed the overview file loading which isn't needed in the new spectator mode (bug #104)
		O Removed many unused sprites, which should fix the "128 HUD sprites" error
		O Fixed bile bomb / acid rocket / stomp can be fired through thin walls (bug #67)
		O Fixed players gestating "through" things (bug #33).
		O Fixed bug where authentication queries were happening too often (every hour instead of every 2 hours)
		O Secure playtest servers now update authentication data every 10 minutes or so, resulting in less chaos and frustration for last-minute SteamID updaters (bug #109)
		O Fixed bug where armory and phase gates useable while being recycled  (bug #65)
		O Replaced Enhanced Hearing with "focus".  Each level of focus slows your weapon/ability rate of fire by 30%, and increases effectiveness (damage, duration) by 10%.  Doesn't currently give a benefit to use of umbra or blink.

	2.1j
	----
		O Update Constellation DB and e-mails
		O Fix focus issues where marine weapons could be affected
		O Each level of focus now slows attacks by 20% instead of 30%

		O Fixed "Gestating while leaping causes crash" (bug #102) (thanks Alpha & the whole GaB-Clan!)

		O Removed legacy "frost" damage icon shown after being digested and while drowning (bug #68)
		O "Transient" entities (ammo, health, weapons, scans) no longer show up on commander minimap (bug #92)

		O Removed display of a lot of non-essential error tooltips with autohelp off
		O New version of co_ulysses

			O Crash bug(s)
			- http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=18&t=48187&hl=&s=1ce7269981ff8047764fa0004efcdf7a
			Confirmed: Duffy crashes on WON, under 2.0 and 2.01 every time on ns_eclipse, by joining marines.  GF4 MX, XP-Pro.  Crashes every time.
				Screen freezes, sound loops. I have to Ctrl+Alt+Del it.
				Detonator: 6.14.10.4403
				There are a couple of frames of animation before it dies. Sometimes the black fade-in is completely opaque, sometimes I can slightly see through it. The health, armor, ammo is all there. So is the view model (and it goes through a couple of frames). The extra LMG and Pistol ammo is obtained (and indictated by the pickup sprites on the right).
				Shortcut: C:\Sierra\Counter-Strike\cstrike.exe -console -game ns (Starts in: C:\Sierra\Counter-Strike)
				Tested under HL too, it happened

			Confirmed: 
				NS v2.1m
				Geforce FX, Win XP, SP1, detonator 6.14.0010.4469
				<SantaClaws> well i can reproduce mine every time basically
				<SantaClaws> not the first game...
				<SantaClaws> but any game after that, if i go into rines as the first player
				<SantaClaws> someone joins aliens, i crash
				<Sandrock> I randomly crash even when in the readyroom, not in a join portal
				<SantaClaws> actually i think if i get into rines b4 any aleins comes in i crash
				<SantaClaws> hehe yeah then sometimes i'll crash in ready room too
				<SantaClaws> may only be when i've been on aliens but i cant confirm that
				<SantaClaws> ooer we have a winner
				<Sandrock> hehe
				<Sandrock> santa joined marines, i joined aliens with bind = crash
				<SantaClaws> :)
				<SantaClaws> every time i tell you
				Doesn't crash if one person goes aliens, then you're the first person to join marines
				Crashes 90% of the time when one person goes aliens, and he's the first person to join marines

			<Moebius|naacg> i have never crashed
			<Moebius|naacg> i have a geforce4 mx 440 with agp8x, version: 4.5.2.3
			Some are crashing to desktop, others get nvogl error screen

			Immacolata:
				Spec: XP1 Pro SP1, Audigy Platinum (drivers 383 - latest webupdate), GeForce 3 Ti w 52.21, VIA KT333 mobo with 1,0 Gig.
				Crashing to desktop
				<Immacolata> I have no error screen, its straight to my desktop
				<Immacolata> I have had one OCCASSIONALLY
				<Immacolata> but I havent seen the box for a long while now
				<Immacolata> it might be from an earlier build
				<Immacolata> frequency, predictably if I join marines as the first
				<Immacolata> at least two times today when we tested
				<Immacolata> (not a lot to make sure fire statements on!)
				<Immacolata> BTW I play with 32 bpp, EAX 1 , both igh and low quality but that didnt seem to change it

			<jacksonj04|> Radeon 9600 crashed on NS:C when present on a team for the start of a round (2.1m)
				it was a crash to desktop, which happened on co_pulse (I think) when joining marines.
				it happened if i was in the marine start area as a round started

	2.1o
	----
		O New ns_agora
			O The surrounding of the marine start are reduced a lot  (all the corridors arround).
			O so the layout has changed a bit
			O sewer's hive has moved (downward) and there is a new siege room (not finishes yet..)
			O this siege room has a funcO weldable to "evacuate" the water and allow the comm to build in it
			O "The pit" is "retextured" with more "cleaver"(brillant) textures, and i've added more crates in it.
			O some nex things (textures, lightings..) almost everywhere
		O Fix for lerk flying animation going into the ceiling (bug #152) (Thanks def_one!)
		O Improved the chat visuals (changed the font and colors and moved it so that it doesn't overlap other HUD elements) (bug #174).
		O Fixed chat and death messages not showing up while being digested (bug #161).
		O Fixed right clicking not properly canceling a building in commander mode (bug #197).
		O Fixed bug where spectators couldn't see living player's chat (bug #10).
		O Re-added lerk bite in place of spikes!
		O Tweaked lerk physics to allow more control
		O Fixed entity leak, resulting in nasty server performance. (bug #183)

		O Changed focus to affect only slot 1
		O Increased hive healing rate in Combat mode
		O Webbed players can now be unwebbed by welding them
		O Added "catalysts" to marine tech tree!
			O Research at arms lab, allows dropping of "cat-packs"
			O A marine that touches pack, gives +25% movmement speed and +25% rate of fire for 8 seconds.  The marine also takes damage equal to 25% of his max health, but it will never kill him.
		O Increased hive health from 6000 to 7000

		O Get flayra@natural-selection working right, and get HAMBONE set up with steve@natural-selection.org
		O Updated mapping guidelines with BB/CC rules (also alien RT rules)
		O Weapons have no weight in Combat? (weight seems to be working properly)

	public:
		O "Disabled" software rendering mode to prevent exploits (bug #208).
		O Fixed the bug where phase gates can be blocked by alien chambers.  Now any structures on the phase gate (except a hive) will be killed when someone goes through. (bug #190).
		O Enabled +showmap in combat (bug #202).
		O Fixed chat text overlaps command minimap (bug #220).
		O Fix for keys not being released properly while the chat window was open.
		O Changed chat so that it does not go between the ready room and observers.
		O Fixed team chat bug
		O Fixed bug where lerk bite was doing damage of skulk bite (75 instead of 50). However, the bite still does 75 currently, until balance indicates otherwise. Bug #344.
		O Fixed bug where cloaked structures other than SC weren't uncloaking properly which touched (bug #134)
		O Fixed focus ROF issues
		O Add CS-like hotkeys to spectator mode (jump to switch view modes, left to go to previous player, right for next player)

		O Updated version of ns_metal from quazilin
			Map has currently 7 resource nodes.
			+ update-4
			* One res node removed
			* Cooling sys - Res node location changed
			* Little tweaks
			* Cooling hive easier to heal now

		O New co_daimos
			O Reworked Hive Area.
			O "Repaired" ladder at Marine Start to give Aliens easier access this way.
			O Lowered ceilings in some areas a bit.
			O Added additional lights to Cargo Area, Upper Tram Area and Central Sewer Area.

		O New catalyst pack sound
		O Removed health increase for each level in Combat.  If this sucks hard, we'll put it back in.  Hopefully this will both prevent jetpacks/resupply from being all-powerful, and allow more alien diversity.  It also means combat is closer to NS mode.
		O When you level up in Combat, you get 20% of your health back (increases heroics, soloing, and reduce dependence on hive/resupply).
		O Fixed commander mode exploit for research trasference to wrong building (bug #199)

		O Fixed bug where you couldn't +use (switches, phasegates) anything when reloading, or use sayings.  Bug #116.  (also fixes bug #182: "HMG sometimes not received immediately if purchased while reloading shotgun", also fixes "unspent level could added back after being spent" (bug #209), also fixes "joining a game causes temporary loss of HMG or GL" (bug #166))
		O Swapped spit and health spray back to 2.0x configuration (so spit is focusable, healing spray isn't)
		O Fixed bug where givepoints plays a sound in combat mode (cheats only, bug #153)
		O Refactor "set commander" message, fixing problem where current commander couldn't always be seen by late-joiners and HLTV spectators (bug #195).
		O Removed "active node count" messages.  I think I'd like to test it without.  This was originally a tool for finding big balance problems, and as we got closer to the 2.0 ship date, it was too risky to remove.  Now is the time to remove it, to see how it plays without it. (bug #231)
		O Reduced size of Onos "ring" 
		O Fixed various problems with mines and commander mode (bug #95)
		O Fixed bug which was preventing mines from getting damage upgrades
		O Fixed "catalysts don't require research" (bug #223)
		O Increased jetpack energy cost by around 30% to make it more close to 2.01 levels
		O Fixed sprite/font rendering artifacts in Direct3D mode (bug #234)
		O Stop-gap collision fixes (fixes resource towers for now)
		O Lerk Flight v2.0!  Has both Flying (tap jump) and Gliding (hold jump).  We have more work to do here, but I think you'll see that Max made him MUCH more maneuverable.  Make sure to press in the direction you want to fly while flapping.
		O Fixed bug where you couldn't talk or +use while you were reloading (finally!)

		O Scoreboard v2.0
		   O Don't show enemy scores (bug #28)
		   O Add kills column (so both kills and score are shown)
		   O Sort players by score, which is non-combat points + kills - deaths (bug #224)
		   O Free up room to display tracker icon
		   O Gamma-corrected scoreboard labels
		   O Don't draw +/- score when going to ready room

		O Items, weapons and structures will no longer fall through sloped surfaces or stairs!  There is still a problem with railings that we're working on.
		O Code to get ready for changing the grenade launcher to reload like the shotgun, this should be in 2.1r
		O Fixed bug where aliens can see some "health received" and "ammo received" messages (bug #61)
		O Fixed problem where "ready" didn't set team ready in tourny mode (maybe a side effect of the new chat system?)
		O Refactored shotgun into AvHBaseReloadableWeapon, in preparation of extending grenade launcher off this (as soon as the artwork is done)
		O Fixed bug where "phase tech" research option not disabled after research completed (bug #75)
		O Charge damage increased from 240/second to 320/second
		O Leap damage increased from 60/second to 80/second
		O Fixed "hive is under attack" sound not played soon/often enough (fixes other important alerts too) (bug #48)
		O Fixed bug where "hive is complete" sound rarely plays (bug #43)
		O Fixed "frozen" turrets/siege turrets bug (bug #83)
		O Fixed bug where recycling unbuilt structures doesn't return correct amount of resources (was going to be 100%, but needs to be lower for gameplay reasons).  Now it returns 80% of the cost.  (bug #204)
		O Added alien resource overflow (bug #87)
		O Fixed "alien 'use' sound played during failed attempt to use marine radio command (bug #159)
		O Reduced time to wait before reusing the command station from 12 seconds to 5 seconds (if we start seeing overflow issues, I'm going to change this back)
		O Increased electricity range, to encourage alternate defense, and in anticipation of new structure spacing (also fixes problems where tricky aliens could sometimes munch electrified targets without taking damage)
		O Fixed bug where loss of arms lab upgrades if armory is recycled (bug #185)

	2.1q part deux
	--------------
		O Clamped airspeed for all players (this came undone somehow).  Rolled back jetpack energy cost to compensate.
		O No longer subtract deaths from score to avoid commonly negative scores.  Also, in case of tie score, sort by least # of deaths.
		O Fixed ultra-fast welding
		O Lowered rate of fire on lerk bite
		O Changed lerk flight so that flapping "up" uses the world space up direction and not the object space up direction.
		O Added new version of co_ulysses
		O Added a minimum build radius for marine buildings.  Increased electricity distance slightly to compensate.
		O Fixed a bug which caused the client to crash if ESC was pushed in the Steam UI before a game was joined.
		O Some minor player/object collision improvements (so players can fit through gaps more easily)
		O Test delta when commanding

	Public:
		O New agora
			_in Marine-Start: Window removed, and downward entrance modified to resolve some FPS issue
			_in M-S: Lowered the platform
			_in M-S: moved the "Ressource point" near the crates
			_"The Pit" is modified and reduced (a bit)
			_the "Steam tunnel" is completely removed (so there is only one acces to "Cargo Hive" for marines, but there is still 3 vents for aliens/jetpack)
			_Ressource Point in "U-turn" has moved into "Tunnel" (the side near U-Turn)
			_"U-turn" is reduced and has a new name: "C-Blue LT21"
			_The corridors to acces "Tunnel Hive" are redesigned
			_The room between "Tunnel" and "Freight Elevator Acces" has now a name: "Piping's System 42b"
			_New textures in "Pumping Station 01" , the "underwater acces" is a bit modified.
			_Ready Room's lighting modified
			_Typo's error (info_location) fixed
			_Added more sounds and  2 particles systems

		O Added votemap system (especially for vet program) that works just like in CS.  Type votemap for a list of maps and their current votes.  Type votemap # to cast your vote for a map.  Servers can disable by setting mp_mapvoteratio to -1, or can set the percentage of players needed for a vote to succeed by setting mp_mapvoteratio from 0-1.
		O Fixed bug in umbra that was causing it to block 1 in 3 bullets, instead of letting through 1 in 3 bullets
		O Minor tweaks to the sprite rendering to fix missing pixels on certain font characters.
		O Fixed bug where players couldn't be muted via the scoreboard (mouse behavior) (bug #211).
		O Fixed one pixel border on some of the minimaps (bug #275)
		O Changed the font on the popup menu so that it fits in the nodes better.
		O Changed the mouse input to invert the horizontal axis if the camera is upside down (this is neat if you are flying and you set cl_pitchup and cl_pitchdown to 1000)
		O Fix for "lines" showing up on the minimap.
		O Change marine resource and commander status labels to use the NS font drawing routines so that they have a more consistent appearance with the rest of the HUD.

		O Fixed structures sinking when placed in vents (bug #148) (!!)
		O Fixed hive spawning bug
		O Added catalyst-pack artwork
		O Fixed airspeed cap problems (back to 2.1o)
		O Lowered lerk bite damage from 75 to 60 to avoid hard to stop one-bite focus kills
		O Tweaked lerk flight energy cost, physics and ground speed (to not feel quite so heavy, and to be able to really soar)
		O Fixed issues with blinking while on the ground (bug #221)
		O Fixed bug where HA footsteps didn't play when armor 3 was researched (bug #49)
		O "numents" command now works with cheats on, or in playtest builds (this is for you Grep)
		O Fixed problem with bullets not hurting teammtes with mp_friendlyfire 1

		O Combat issues
			O Changed wave spawning so there is a minimum wait of 8 seconds before respawning (ie, you will spawn with the next wave).  This will make respawning groups smaller, allowing bases to be attacked more easily.
			O Players now gain full health and armor on a level-up
			O Increased amount of experience needed to go up each level from 40% to 50% (so players level up slightly slower, and higher levels significantly harder to get)
			O Removed minimap from Combat
			X Aliens now gain Combat experience when alive
			O Players now get experience for damaging hive or CC

		O Server CPU work (blasted turrets).  This should fix all the lagginess and bad server performance we've been experiencing in NS mode (bug #278). THIS IS ALSO HUGE.
		O Fixed players getting stuck in vents after gestating to a fade (bug #209)
		O Fixed players getting stuck when gestating from onos to skulk on a ramp (bug #205)
		O Now players get XP for welding the CC or healing the hive (if it gets abused in tourny mode, I can fix it).  Only give experience for hurting enemy structures or repairing friendly structures.
		? Scan is now more effective in Combat (cloaked player no longer has to be in sight, only in range)
		O Mine kills no longer share experience to players that happen to be nearby to the mine owner when they detonate
		O Focus now slows down your rate of fire more, making it more of a finesse/anti-player upgrade (it's original intent)

		v3.0a (For NS LAN)
		-----
			O Fixed bug where aliens sometimes appear as a marine player and then turn into a skulk. when dying, sometimes an alien player will briefly appear as a marine (bug #193)
			O Fixed turrets/OCs targeting anomalies (bug #329)
			O Fixed music playback (updated to FMOD 3.7.1)
				O Fixed problem where music stops playing on map change
				O Fixed problem where music stops playing when going to third person camera
			O Fixed grenade launcher reload animations
			O New siege deploy animation and "inactive" state (thank Mojo!)
			X Focus not working on win32 (build in release, Max)
			? Near-final version of ns_agora.
				O Just 1 big change in this version concerning the second acces to Cargo Hive (re-added especially for you ;) )
				O Added 2 or 3 crates in "The Pit" and "C-Transport" and 1 vent to acces "Analysis Lab".
				O Fixed format of sounds (giving conversion errors)
				O Added missing xsmoke1.spr sprite
			O Fixed acid rocket colliding with attacker when moving forward (bug #163)
			O Fixed bile bomb, acid rocket and stomp able to be fired through thin walls (bug #67)
			O Added new hive flinch anims for when hive is building (thanks Mojo!)
			O Updated infantry portal artwork to get rid of z-buffering issues (thanks Mojo!)
			O Fixed welding/healing exploit in Combat (bug #328)
			O Renamed version to v3.0 :)
			O Removed spawn invulnerable time by default in Combat (as a test)

			O Updated co_angst (ChromeAngel)
				- New sounds, a new sky, changed lighting, more sensitive doors and warning sights on the closed doors.   
				- Can you give me some feedback on the lighting and check the terms of use in the skybox use are compatible with NS before I send in the MAP and the rest of the gubbins.
				- Im thinking of moving the doorway from the bridge to the observatory further towards the back of the bridge, I think this might work around a VIS glitch in the observatory.  Since no-one else appears to have noticed and it could cause an r_speed jump elsewhere it Im not sure its worth doing.
				- Write about nebula skybox (get Chalupa to create?)

			O Updated co_kestrel (DevilDog)
				- There is a new way into the hive.  When taking the Subhangar 5 route, after passing through the subhangar, and going through the elevator shaft, you turn left normally.  I've opened up the right side door now as well which uses a small corridor that dumps you into the hive - right under it in fact, where the closed door use to be.  This leaves a total of 4 ways into the hive now.
				- I widened the hall from the hive to the comm room.
				- Moved the hive up so the room is clear and move friendly.  
				- The hangar I dropped portion of the floor (turned it into a lift) and tucked the CC down in it.  Its open enough so its not like it was before when it was in that alcove originally, but the lowering of the floor gives it cover from respawning marines (They need to run up to it and look down).

			O Updated co_ulysses (Blueman)
				:: New RR (still needs some work)
				:: New MS cause many people hated old one.
				:: Added another vent (4 in total)
				:: Changed lighting all over the map.

		Public:
			O Fixed some structure bounding boxes where parts of them couldn't be hit (bug #247)
			O Removed walking dependence on cl_forwardspeed
			O Fixed "shooting-the-egg" crash
			O Fixed the bug where items (medpacks, ammo, weapons, etc.) couldn't be dropped directly on players.
			O Combat tuning
				O Removed health/armor on level up
				O Removed distress beacon
				O Removed gorges
				O Removed experience for welding (didn't want to remove welding totally)
				O Added cat-packs to Combat (players are catalysted a short time after they make a kill, if they aren't currently catalysted)
				O Mines are no longer give you 5 mines once, but give you one mine per life (can't suicide in Combat so it shouldn't be abusable)
			O Added hand-grenades (thanks BrigadierWolf!)
				O Grenades don't detonate on contact, only after 4 seconds.
				O Available in Combat as regular upgrade (1 per life).
				O Available in regular NS as upgrade at armory.  After researched, all marines spawn with a single grenade.
			O Lowered lerk flap energy cost slightly
			O Removed new hitbox code to see if it lessens server crashing
			O Fixed bug where "impulse 1" does not cycle through slot 4 marine weapons (bug #178)
			O Increased Onos health/armor from 500/400 to 900/500 to compensate for new 4x hitbox 
			O New co_kestrel
				O I removed the "roof" over the CC and brought it out just a touch away from the wall (its still down in the elevator).  This should solve the virtual invicibility that skulks have hiding behind it in which marines have to jump down in and often die to protect the CC.  Marines should be able to now just  look down and shoot.
				O Generate new minimap sprite
			O Playtesting new map: co_rebirth

		Private:
			Hambone: i think onos health should go back to how it used to be
			Hambone: 500/350
			Hambone: and they should get a small speed increase
			Hambone: i think gorges should be put back in, but I realized something crucial which is
			Hambone: not only did the hive heal itself at an astounding rate
			Hambone: but gorges healed the hive at a much faster rate than normal
			Hambone: so i say put gorge healing back to normal and put them back in
			Hambone: i think hand grenades should be exact replicas of grenade launcher grenades
			Hambone: explode on impact and same dmg
			Hambone: i think cloaking should be 10% visibility or something like that
			Hambone: and I think that cloak-walking should get taken out
			Hambone: if you arent going to nerf web, maybe put spawn invul back in for marines (i'd prefer to nerf web)
			Hambone: stomp is too good although its always been too good
			Hambone: i still think you should go back to the old faster spawning system
			Hambone: and i think you should raise the speed cap

			O Server performance (cache AvHPlayer::GetAuthenticationMask() to see if it improves server CPU noticeably)
				- Work with bots on dedicated server
				- Looks like two problems
					- 1. 1+% per human player overhead, which isn't present with bots
						- Test with live people, using profiling to figure out what main loop is causing it.
					- 2. 20+ bots starts to really spike.
						- 40% of this seems to be kUpdateWorldEntitiesProfile
						- Chunk is kUpdateWorldEntitiesUpdateBlips
							- Optimized slightly, see if measurable
						- A chunk seems to be AvHPlayer::PreThink
					- 8 people in RR
						- mp_performance of 0 results in 1% per player, about CS levels
						- removing just AddToFullPack gives about 1% per player back
						- Removing player thinking in RR, results in 1-2% total less CPU
						- Up to 1% less by removing the world update
					- 3. 16 players on ns_caged, on AA, on 2.01 under Steam, average of .5%, spiking to 1.5-3% (AA 2.1s was 20-25% avg, same people).  15 players, 2.01, steam, avg of 15%.
					- Could it be that errant health message, or extra messages in general?
					- Next step: keep reverting builds until we get to 2.01, or until there's no change (bisect)
				- v2.0 under Steam (dedicated server .zip), 5 people in RR or so, negligble server CPU (ns_caged)
				- v2.1a under Steam, 5 people or so, negligible server CPU (ns_caged) (.06%-.15%)
				- v2.1b under Steam, 7 people or so, .10% CPU, in RR and even with a commander and micro-game (ns_caged)
				- v2.1c had auth errors, no one could connect
				- v2.1d has auth errors, as does 2.1e
				- v2.1f, 9 people in RR, .08% average
				- v2.1g, 6 people playing, .11% average, 1.5% max (ns_caged)
				- v2.1h (full), 8 people in real NS game, .28% average
				- v2.1i, 
				- v2.1m, 14 players in real game, average 12%, max of 20% (AA, ns_caged).  This is too high, as LB's 2.01 steam server avg's 0%
				- v2.1a, again, 12 people, semi-real game of NS, average is .45%
				- v2.1b, 14 people, semi-real game, average is .45%
				- v2.1f, 14 people, semi-real game, average is 2.7%.  16 players at two hives go to 20% or so (STEAM I believe) (**BAD**)
				- v2.1c, 14 people, semi-real game, average is .237% (game time at 5 mins) WON (**GOOD**)
				- v2.1d, 10 people, semi-real game, average is .095% or less (game time 4 mins or so) WON (**GOOD**)
				- v2.1e, 13 people, real game, average is .5%, max of 6.2% (game time is 15 mins) WON (**GOOD**)
				- v2.1f, 13 people, full game (very marine-sided though), less then 1% CPU, WON (**GOOD**)
				- v2.1f, 10 people, semi-real game, less then 1% CPU, Steam
				- Next day:
				- v2.1g, Steam, couldn't get it to run, skipping it
				- v2.1h (full install), Steam, 13 people (2 are spectating), real game, .66% average (turrets, phase, d-chambers, etc.).  Then we got to 14 people, and some turrets were built.  The CPU started responding drastically to more sentries, but not to more entities.
				- v2.1f Steam, 
				- v3.0b Steam, 22 players, co_kestrel, 
					- readyroom CPU is .13%
					- Joining teams without game starting (tourny mode), CPU averages 25%
					- After game starts, CPU averages 22% or so
				- same but on ns_caged
				- v2.1q: 18 players, ready room was fine, even teams before game started is 13%.  Game started without doing anything, up to 19% or so.
				- v2.1h: 14 players, 5 specs, 9% before game starts, after games starts
				- v3.0b: 26 players, before game starts, profile build, Steam:
					- CPU is at 43%! 
					- mp_performance of 534 (no AddToFullPack), down to 12% maybe? (crash)

				- Remember that numbers aren't absolute, as Profile build changes it:
				- v3.0b: 26 players, before game starts, profile build, Steam: (ns_caged)
					- 35%, down to 10% with mp_performance of 534
					- ns_kestrel, 25 players, before game starts: 
						- 13%, down to 0 without AddToFullPack
					- ns_tanith (394 ents)
						- 50%, down to 30% without AddToFullPack
						- 26% without marine/alien thinking
					- ns_eclipse (305 ents)
						- 33%, down to 7% without AddToFullPack, 14% withtout marine/alien thinking
						- 37% to 27% without gamerules thinking
					- co_faceoff (213 entities)
						- 11% before game starts on teams, 4% without AddToFullPack (this should be the amount we can fix is my guess, with the other part being profile-related and entity-based/unavoidable)
						- all marines, 25 people still, 1.1% (this may not have been 1023)
						- all aliens, 8.5%!!!!  Even with alien thinking off, it's still 8%
						- all marines with 1023, 5%, all aliens is 16%

				- Ideas:
					- Alerts
					? Status bar (lower update time)
					? For every entity, GetIsRelevant() blocks (change for gamestarted)
					x Phase gate blocking
					? Visibility enhancements 
					- Make sure entity caching is in effect

		Public:
			O Fixed sighting through transparent surfaces (sighting for siege behaves very oddly in certain locations. most importantly, it seems to fail through any kind of glass, such as the hera glass tube, bug #361)
			O Reduced skulk armor from 20 to 10.  Explanation - Now that the skulk hitbox is fixed, it's half the height that it used to be, making skulks much harder to hit.
			O Encourage marines to move out by adding slow alien XP gain over time (currently 1 XP every three seconds)
			O Made respawn times scaleable for small games.  If x is the number of players on your team, respawn waves happen every x seconds.  
			O Removed minimum spawn time because it felt like a bug.  Generally spawning is faster now.
			O Server performance improved!  Thanks to everyone in #nstest that put in many long hours to find this. (bug #278)
			O Added missing co_rebirth.wad
			O Moved the skulk model so that it rotates around its center rather than its hind legs. This should look more natural when wall walking and the make the skulk's head stick out less when hiding (Thanks Mojo!)
			O Fixed mouse focus problems with commander minimap and alert buttons (bugs #357 and #335)
			O Fix for mouse pointer disappearing sometimes when switching between programs using the taskbar (bug #363)
			O Took out "special", "_special" and "wait" commands to prevent abusive scripts from being written (especially bunny-hopping scripts)
			O If both Vet and Constellation access, show Constellation (new order of preference: Custom, Developer, Playtester, Guide (unused), Constellation member, Beta server op, Veteran, Cheating Death)
			O Reduced web potency by reducing min/max ensnare times from 4/10 to 2/5
			O New version of co_ulysses (mostly tweaked marine start and hive room)
			O Updated hand grenade model to prime faster
			O Added in grenade roll animation when crouched
			O Lowered force and gravity or make them bounce less
			O Don't allow grenade ammo to be refilled from armory/resupply
			O Fixed problem where incorrect animations sometimes played
			O Lowered stomp stun duration from 2 seconds to 1 second
			O Armory now occasionally gives health back when used
			O New version of ns_tanith
				-> waste hive more accessable for aliens/onos
				-> new unweldable vent to waste
				-> onos no longer has to crouch anywhere
				-> added weld for top vent in reactor room
				-> removed water vent weld in reactor room
			O ns_metal revision 6
				-> Small layout change
				-> Tweaks and bugfixes
				-> Added res nodes
			O New version of co_rebirth
				-> Added two armories at the marine start
				-> Built a new command room for marines (bigger, higher)
				-> Increased the size of a stockage room for JetPacks and lerks. 
				-> Increased the size of the hive, it was too small and marines had the possibility to shoot it from a far corridor

		O Fixed problem where alien alerts play in rapid succession..your hive is under attack, your h-h-hive... (bug #299)

			O Select all marines
			O Go to health request

			O Added some few things like thanks to playtesters in the co_rebirth.txt ;)
			O Increased size of hive room
			O Waiting for updated map with updated sound name
			O Waiting for smoke sprite

        O ns_metal update-8
            * Tweaks
            * Two more vents
            * Removed one res (Heating room)
            * More infestation near hives

        O Lerk flight tweaks.
            O Turning does not slow you down as much.
            O Energy cost of flapping increased slightly.

        O Allow fakeclients to use impulses to initiate leap, blink and charge (to help bot writers)

        O Fixed getting stunned with primed grenade causes it to be dropped (bug #390).

        O Fixed primed grenade not getting holstered when player is webbed.
        O Fixed grenade prediction problems.
        O Added 3rd person grenade animations.
        O Changed hand grenades so they explode on contact

        O Added grenade sprite artwork (thanks Hackepeter and Max!)

        O Reworked tech tree to allow different Combat upgrades to cost different numbers of levels.  Lerk, jetpack and Onos now each cost two levels to purchase.
        O Improved pop-up menu to more accurately show you what's available and when (for aliens)
        ? HUD sound precedence issues (bug #402)

        O Important note: alien armor is affected by the number of hives you have.  1 hive means armor is worth 1.6 points of health, 2 hives means it's worth 2 points of health, 3 hives means it's worth 2.4 points of health.  It's been this way since the first version of 3.0, but keep this in mind when attacking.
        O Increased Onos health from 600 to 700
        O Reduced Onos cost from 100 to 75
        O Reduced Fade cost from 60 to 50
        O Increased build-hive score from 5 to 8
        O Increased Combat spawn times a bit more (max wait is 45 seconds, up from 30).
        O Reduce Onos gore range from 130 to 90 (he shouldn't be able to pick JPs out of the air)
        O Fixed lerk death animations (bug #276)

        O Added anti-scripting code (activated when mp_blockscripts is 1).  When enabled, it blocks any command with wait, _special, exec or a ; in it.  This is off by default.  
        O New primal scream sprite with a lerk instead of an onos (Thanks CoolCookieCooks!)       

        O Fixed problem where players taking melee damage while spawn-invulnerable were still pushed around
        O Changed parasite to organic damage (only hurts living targets), so they can't be used against mines.  The "parasite-hit" sound only plays when you newly parasite a player or structure, or when you do damage to a target.
        ? Gameplay test: with Hambone mode enabled, res towers give a resource point every 2 seconds, instead of every 4.
  
        O Tournament mode no longer necessarily includes friendly fire (mp_friendlyfire controls it completely).
        O Cleaned up and unified server.cfg and listenserver.cfg.
        O Removed some extraneous server variables.
        O Removed unpopular server and game options from the UI
        O Added dynamic loading of FMOD DLL from the ns mod directory (to eliminate compatibility problems with other mods).
        O Fixed bug where players sometimes crash when joining marine team (bug #404, introduced in changelist 1895).  Grepdashv, you rule!
        O Fixed bug where cloaked aliens are visible to marines who are spectating while waiting to respawn.  Dead players now see cloaked entities as the person they are watching does.  True spectators see cloaked targets when they are spectating a person in non-first-person mode. (bug #295)
        O Fixed bug where hive wouldn't spawn if blocked by player (bug #391)
        O Removed mp_version variable.  Now the version is reported in the game description.
        O Fixed bug where commander logged into non-primary CC wasn't ejected when it was destroyed (bug #422)
        O Increased heal spray range from 250 to 300, in order to make it easier to heal hives (bug #414)
        O Fixed marines able to +use while stunned (bug #441)
        O Fixed bug where weird recycling can cause inability to buy arms lab upgrades (bug #186)
        O Fixed bug where aliens sometimes appear as a marine when they die or spawn (bug #193)

        3.0g
        -----
        Private:
        O Update asset list with final map list
        O Removed HPB_bot.dll from asset list
        ? If SteamID authentication data isn't prefixed by "STEAM_", add it

        Before public release:
            O Get Constellation mailing list fully up to date and working
            O Announce other mailing lists

        Public:
        O Fixed grenade problem introduced in 3.0f (but #452)
        ? Updated command station grenade upgrade sprite (thanks Hackepeter!)
        O Fixed problem where jetpacks cost one level instead of two
        O Fixed new bug where Combat levels weren't spent properly as marine (reworked how purchases are validated and made)
        ? Fixed authentication problem caused by duplicate WONids

        O Fixed bug where a selectable ghost structure was left behind when original CC was recycled (bug #445)
	    O Fixed bug where CC started out unbuilt in the next round if it was recycled last round (bug #445)
        O Fixed alien melee attacks often cannot break grates at pointblank range (bug #440)
        O Fixed problems with commander unable to drop some items on top of  other items (bug #291)
        O Changed references to sv_cheats on the client to use the new server variable system (particle system editing and cl_showspeed).
        ? Fixed problem where grenade assets weren't included properly
        O Fixed bug where number of hives didn't affect alien armor properly (bug #453)
        ? Updated co_angst to fix end of game spawn problems (bug #421)
        O Reverted config.cfg to reasonable default
        O Removed cl_forwardspeed, cl_backspeed, cl_sidespeed (bug #438)

        O Changed alien armor value from 1.6, 2, 2.4 to 2, 2.5, 3 (this will help late-game fade and onos considerably without boosting him too much in Combat)
        O Increased alien armor absorption with more hives, to make sure there is never armor left over (armor takes 70% of damage at hive 1, 80% at hive 2, 90% t hive 3, used to be 70% for all)
        O Reduced lerk base speed from 200 to 175
        O Increased speed boost lerk gets from celerity (8.3 to 25)
        ? Fixed bug that was causing redemption to be way too effective

        O New ns_nancy
            ? Included ns_nancy overview sprite
            O Fixed horrible ladder bug that would throw players up into the air.
            O Air Filtration System fan no longer can be built on and no longer spins the commander view.
            O Texture alignment fixes.
            O Lighting tweaks
            O Raised Subspace vent and made it so you can weld it shut on Subspace side.

        O Fixed bug where Combat exploit allows a single earned level to be spent repeatedly (bug #466)
        O Fixed bug in Combat where respawn time circumvented using ready room (bug #467)

        NS v3.0 beta 2
        --------------
        Private:
        O Write Will Day about metamod update

        ? Tweaked Combat respawn times to faciliate shorter games (slightly longer minimum respawn time, slightly shorter maximum respawn time)
            ? From roughly 0 - 45 seconds (depending on size of game and number of spent levels) to 5 - 40 seconds
            - Spawn system:
                - Want people to spawn in waves, though without such an advantage that they can repel any force. Waves allow them to attack in unison though.
                - Is there any reason to increase spawn time for high-level players?  Used to be for Oni, but that should be fixed now.
                - Still need to scale on team size though
        X Check into Combat entity leak (co_daimos, 306 ents in an NS:C game.. 280 of which are not even cleared on map change...)
        X Attempted to fix problem where gamma wasn't being set properly on dual-monitor systems (bugs #b62 and #364, dual users, please report back)

        Public:
        O Changed Combat respawn system.  Players now respawn in bigger waves, and time to wait depends only on team size (so smaller games spawn faster).  Spawn times vary from 4 seconds (1v1) to 25 seconds (16v16).
        O The return of the Gorge to Combat!  This should address the problem where marines can heal their CC easily while the aliens cannot.

        O Fixed bug in UTIL_SharedRandomFloat that fixes bug where bullet holes were firing with perfect accuracy for everyone but the shooter (bug #233)
        O Changed catalyst packs so they no longer do damage to recipient
        O Fixed bug where holding walk key while cloaked sometimes allowed you to move too fast and uncloak you
        O Halved acid rocket damage and energy cost (to make rockets more fun to use)
        O Fixed bug where lerk sometimes showed spike model
        O Fixed bug where aliens sometimes spawned with the wrong weapon selected (bug #249)
        O Increased Fade stats from 250/100 to 300/150 (+33% damage capacity)
        O Increased Onos stats from 700/500 to 700/600
        O Increased cost of heavy armor to 2 levels (Combat)

        O Increased redemption chance from 30% per second per level to 35% per second per level
        O Experience is again awarded for repairing the CC or healing the hive (currently 1/3 the amount). Removed faster hive healing in Combat to compensate.
        O Changed welder to have a random ROF (gameplay effects should be unchanged)
        O New welder sound
        O Electricity damage reduced from 25 to 20 (to compensate for increased range)
        
        O Scan upgrade can no longer be purchased multiple times in Combat (bug #478)
        O Fixed bug where options on the pop-up menu looked like they were available before they actually were (also bug #478) (should also fix bug where prices weren't shown in NS mode)
        O Fixed issues with alien pop-up menu in NS mode (bug #471)

        O Fixed bug where aliens with level 3 movement upgrades were taking 1/2 damage from turrets (Thanks Fortuna Wolf!)
        O Added missing credits list to ns_agora

        O Fixed bug where Metabolize interfered with regeneration (bug #356)
        O Fixed bug where Metabolize cost more energy to use then energy it gave back
        O Changed hive healing so it now scales healing by the target's hitpoints (the hive now heals 6% of a player's hitpoints per second)

        O Changed "kills" to be actual number of players killed, not adjusted for type/level of lifeform (thanks Lux!)
        O Removed mp_spawninvul variable (it defaulted to 0 before so this won't change most servers)

        O Installer fixes (WON/multiple Steam ids)
        O Temporarily removed playback of intro movies until we figure out how to encode them properly
        
        O Updated ns_metal (thanks quazilin!)
            * Tweaks
            * Fixed crash bug when cheats were enabled

        O Updated ns_nancy (thanks Lazer!)
            O Added ladder to vent outside of Marine Start. (the "death vent")
            O Port Hive lowered a little, south wall moved back in to be a little more like the 1.x version.
            O Made Subspace vent even more gorge friendly.
            O Better clipping on ceilings of hallways so getting into the ceiling vents becomes a lot more possible without leap.
            O Lowered r_speeds, and other assorted tweaks.
            O Added a few things to the readyroom... :]

        O Updated co_pulse (thanks tommyd!)
            - improved marine spawn point locations
            - added more room to the marine start

        O Updated ns_tanith (thanks tommyd!)
            - removed welds near waste hive to prevent marine camping
            - fixed in-the-void siege/building exploit near fusion hive
            - fixed vent-siege-building in new vent by waste hive

    v3.0 beta 3
    -----------
        O Combat respawning change: only 1/4 of the team can respawn at a time (waves last 5-11 seconds, depending on team size).  This reduces Combat game length significantly, and gives much more importants to player death.

        O All new ns_hera (massive server CPU optimizations and balance changes) (thanks Merkaba!)
            O Data Core Alpha replaced with old Hera material which allows easier attack on the archive hive (no lifts)
            O Marines can now go from the marine start to the warehouse without having to weld open anything.
            O Warehouse is now connected to the holoroom via a small corridor.
            O No more vents lead into marine start.
            O Two more resource nodes added to the map. One in the fog corridor, and one in Systems Handling (where data core alpha used to be). The old node in that area has been moved into the Archiving hive.
            O Archiving a little wider now, so the upper level isn't so cramped.
            O Total entity count is now < 240
            O Walkway no longer in an ineffecient U shape.
            O Fog Corridor shortened.
            O Various little fixes and touchups.
            O Readyroom changes (shorter MS start, no egg)

        O Added "Xfire" support to the installer (optional).  This is an instant messenger for gamers, and will auto-update full NS support later this week.  Visit www.xfire.com for more information.

        O Updated hand grenade sounds (new explosion, bounce, prime, etc.)
        O Fixed bug where grenade launcher grenades death messages used hand grenade sprite
        O Sped up resupply time at armory slightly
        O Reduced mine health to 20 (so gorges can easily take them out with spit and marines can detonate them in combat with FF)
        O Purchasing mines now gets you 4 mines instead of 5
        O Hand grenades now do less damage then grenade launcher grenades (100 instead of 125)
        O Increased rate at which hives heal friendly players (from 6% per second to 15% per second)
        O Fixed bug where heal spray wasn't working for many hives
        O Removed preservation of experience when leaving the team because of abuse

        O Updated co_kestrel (thanks DevilDog!)
            O Extended existing vent near subhangar to also allow access to MS
            O Added "Hangar 7 Control" room which sits above and looks into the MS.  This provides another way into the MS for a total of 2 normal, 1 accessible by all but Ohnos, and 1 vent
            O Hive slightly moved and a vent added from the ladder that goes up to the escape pod that "looks" at the hive.  This serves as a perch to allow gorges to heal the hive (they can't reach it from the ground).  
            O Couple of texture fixes
        
        O Updated ns_ayumi (thanks DrunkenMonkey!)
            O The elevator outside marine start is replaced with a ramp.
            O A new weldable just outside the "AE35" hive that open up a door to "Gorges Hideout".
            O A new ladder in "Star Child".
            O The rails are gone in "Eastern Entrance" to make the room more open, and also is the hallways that leads to that room remade.
            O The "Hamasaki" hive have gotten a new exit.
            O The hive in "Pressure Control" have been raised a little bit, so it can no longer be blocked by structures.
            O A new vent in "Pressure Control".
            O New sky.
            O New ambient sounds in all of the three hives.
            O Lots of tweaks all over the map, to make it easier and more fun to play.

        O Updated co_ulysses (thanks Blueman!)
            O Fixed clip error at the hive
            O Added co_ulysses back into the mapcycle

        O Fixed clipping problems on ns_nothing (thanks KungFuSquirrel!)

        O Updated co_rebirth (thanks IAN!)
            O A big change with this version, because I built a new level just under the marine start, trying to encourage marines to get out.
            O Increased the size of corridors just next the rebirth room, built a little vent inside the MS for skulks and lerks (I enjoy the idea they could be hidden in the ms itself) and I built a place for gorges in the Hive room to heal the hive and perhaps will it help marines too. 
            O Doors in general stay open longer

        O Updated co_angst (thanks ChromeAngel!)
            O Revamped marine start
            O Other unlisted changes that were apparently favorably received by playtesters

        O Fixed incompatibility with server mod menus (bug #482).
        O Fixed cannot type text into the chat box while CTRL is pressed (bug #491)

        O New co_daimos, to help fix problem where Oni have trouble spawning sometimes (thanks Hypergrip!)

            O Removed wave spawn to shorten game length (only one person spawning at a time).

            - New vents (find/learn them yourselves ;) ) 
            - Some added infestation in hive areas 
            - Layout/architecture tweaks near Pipeline 
            - Weldables added to Nanogrid Status

        O Updated ns_nothing (thanks KungFuSquirrel!)
            O Elevators changed to func_doors

        O Upgrading a turret factory no longer restores all its hit points (bug #539)

        O Items no longer sink through the world when placed against slopes, items can now be placed at up to 45 degrees, on stairs, etc.  (bug #291, bug #527)

Beta 4a
-------
O Combat changes (near final!):
-> Aliens no longer grow in experience over time (we didn't have time to test this properly last week)
-> There is now a time limit (like old Combat builds!), which by default is 10 minutes.  Aliens automatically win after time expires, or if they take out the CC.  Marines win by taking out the hive.
-> This time limit can be adjusted using mp_combattime
-> Moved game timer off of scoreboard and onto HUD
-> When there is less then a minute left, the game time readout blinks (both Combat and NS/tournament mode)
-> Focus cost increased from 1 to 2 levels
-> Because marines lose if timelimit is reached, sped marine spawning by 1 second to compensate
O Fixed demo recording crash
O Improved server performance (for programmers: we built using a debug version of STLport by accident).  There may still be a problem with escalating pings we're still looking into.
O Reduced umbra power so it now blocks 1 out of 2 bullets (down from 2 out of 3)
O Grenades no longer teleport into the void before exploding when they are shot into vents (bug #530)
O Abbreviated "Natural Selection" in Steam server list so it's easier to filter by version
O Removed mp_gametime server variable as it is no longer needed
O Fixed gamma problems on map change for maps that didn't specify an env_gamma (usually custom maps)
O Fixed exploit where weapons can be nearly instantly reloaded (bug #334)
O Fixed bug where death messages overlapped spectator UI
O Rewritten structure collision detection from XP-Cagey should mean many less sinking items!
O Lerk flight costs energy again (1/2 the energy cost of beta 3)
O Fixed missing textures in beta 4 (goodbye random pink-checkerboards)
O Removed consistency checking of unnecessary files (mp_consistency 1) (thanks mahnsawce!) (bug #297)
O Updated ns_nancy (helpful for CAL)
-> You should no longer be able to siege Port/Subspace without spotting it.
-> In an attempt to add a little more balance to the map the vent outside of Port has been turned into a hallway and the stairs to Mother Interface from Messhall were removed.
-> Added a couple crates in the Mother Interface area for cover.
-> Removed unnecessary side room in the Marine Start area. All it did was add a chance of the commander spawning way too far from the CC and had no game purpose.
-> Misc. other smaller changes
O sv_restart now works with cheats on (so you can execute it via rcon by setting cheats first)
O Equipment is now easier to drop on players, buildings can no longer be dropped on players.
O Fixed bug where multiple res towers were allowed to be dropped on the same node (appeared in early versions of 4a)
O Rewrote EntityInfo and NumEnts printout formats to make them more useful to mappers.
-> EntityInfo was reporting the first N entity slots of information instead of the first N valid entities. 
-> Marked several types of entities (player slots, bodyque, weapons) as "dynamic" -- for now at least, they don't count towards the mapping limit

	Beta 5
	------
	- TODO: Add mp_combattime to quick start guide and documentation if it stays
	X Entity leak?
	- 802-658-3842 (VT E-bay guy)
	- Bug where after game ends your role isn't preserved
	- Sparks/crosshair problem
	- Infinite ammo exploit
	
    Beta 5
    ------
	- Overlapping countdown timer in 640x480
   	- Weird spawning bug (http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=69007) (bug #421)
		? Distress beacon
		- Joining teams
		- Game reset
		- Ending digestion
		? Redemption
		- Need to refactor spawning completely
			- Remove spawn checking dependency on player
			- Don't call CBasePlayer::Spawn() at all
			- Refactor SetPlayMode() to not perform spawning at all.  Everyone that calls it should check if the player can spawn first, and if so, call set play mode and spawn them there.

        - Lerks cannot fly backwards (bug #522)

	X if you get killed while you are gestating, you'll respawn at low health values (querty@sandwaves.org)

        - HLTV support (http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000256)
            - Problem:
                X g_iUser1 isn't set on client, because human players aren't being propagated to themselves under HLTV
                X Human players aren't in AddToFullPack in HLTV (but bots are)
                ? g_iUser1 needs to be initialized to 1
                ? Fix check-boxes
                ? Fix overview checkbox
                ? Fix player picker (server-side problem?)
                    - vgui_TeamFortressViewport, line 2230 (g_PlayerExtraInfo is not being filled in)
                    - How to send gmsgTeamInfo messages to spectators?
                - Auto-director button (server-side problem?)
                - Blips on overview (server-side problem?)

        - Crouch-blinking

        - Fade +duck hitbox bug.  When a fade is crouching they are really really hard to hit.  I thought that fades were overpowered and their health or armor should be lowered a little but seeing as how bugged it is, its hard to say
            - Re-size model

        X Remove skulk/bite knockback?  Check beta information forum for discussion.

        <Forlorn> Also you should consider 75/10 stats for skulks
        <Forlorn> This would mean one bullet stronger in the early game
        <Forlorn> but with lv. 1 weapons skulk dies in 1 bullet less
        <Forlorn> Right now lv. 1 weapons gives no advantage against a basic skulk
        <Forlorn> There is no reason to go lv. 1 weapons before lv. 1 armor
        <Forlorn> Also I think that a skulk could use one more bullet

        - **Update create server options

        - Document mp_custom icon in server.cfg and listenserver.cfg

        - "kill" in Combat (remove "kill" override and assume kill delay?)

        * exploit: scanning with observatory for free 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000551] 

        * "under attack" warning messages not played frequently enough 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000300] 

        * greatly increase frequency of visual alerts on commander minimap 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000557] 

        * regen effects do not apply to health and armor in the same tick 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000558] 

        * remove melee push for all weapons except onos gore (claws), and make that have a random direction; current ugly example: a marine can shove an onos around with a knife

        * make umbra clouds have the same duration as spore clouds 

        important changes and balance tweaks: 

        * revert welder RoF back to non-random behavior until a real "fix" for the sounds can be implemented 

        * make armory healing non-random but a much smaller value 

        * de-randomize res-for-kills (making it 2rp for every kill) 

        * revert mine cost to 10rp for 5 mines 

        * eliminate energy cost for slot1 weapons 

        * change healspray back to slot1 for gorge 

        * remove leap damage 

        * make the following visually distinct (color/shape):  parasited marines; parasited structures; marines on SoF; marines detected by SCs (this may sound minor but would be hugely beneficial)
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000481] 

        * allow re-upgrading at full cost (e.g., an alien with silence can bay 2rp for adrenaline instead) 

        * increase base onos speed significantly; it's currently far too slow to be effective without celerity 

        other important fixes: 

        * primal scream doesn't increase player movement speed 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000437] 

        * primal scream does not increase damage from xenocide or parasite (double-check other weapons?) 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000553] 

        * devour often fails 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000434] 

        * redemption fails too often (check more frequently and/or increase chance of success after every failed check?) 

        * rework parasite 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000454] 

        * weapons not dropped properly upon death 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000474] 

        * [combat] resupply not effective for HMG or pistol 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000542] 

        * restore the SC effect where enemies show up on hive sight (as if parasited) when within SC range (remove audible warning "the enemy approaches")

        * weapon upgrades do not affect turrets 
        [http://www.natural-selection.org/bt/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=0000465]

        - Apparently you can shoot through the CC , perhaps should be fixed. But then again, it does make sense, since there is a gap in the CC
        - When the game ends, and when you're an alien, it seems that you are viewing from a Marine model, rather than a skulk model - inwhich is lower to the ground.

		- Hambone feedback
			Hambone: just a few things
			Hambone: onos are way too good
			Hambone: i think combat would be really good if onos wasnt so good
			Hambone: a few other things you could change
			Hambone: lerk flight and jetpacks should be a little faster
			Hambone: still feels to slow
			Hambone: i dont like how aliens gain res
			Hambone: didnt change anything
			Hambone: moving the skulks POV forward but not reducing his range makes the range feel much larger

Info from Alfred
- GameMenu.res is completely ignored under vgui1, TrackerRes.res is used instead
- "Tracker" used to refer to just the Friends list, now it refers to any out-of-game UI
- preface "engine" to allow console commands in game menu
- titles.txt is backwards-compatible and works like it used to, except for one detail: if the text it translates to starts with #, it is referred to resources/modname_language.txt (this file must be Unicode).

CPL success
- Mostly game popularity, and compatible genre, definitely biased towards FPS 

WCG success
- Game popularity, general suitability towards clan play, and probably sponsorship, seems biased towards what's new/cool
