Game objective
--------------
Summary: Multiplayer-only Half-life mod where one team plays marines and the other plays aliens. The humans must keep their cool and work together to assault an alien-infested spacecraft
- "First-person strategy" with a real resource model and consequences for actions
- Both sides are genuinely different and together they accommodate different play styles: 
  1) Fighting skill deemphasized for marines, strategy and communication take their place.  Tense, not breakneck action.
  2) Hero-based action, intuition and reflexes promoted for aliens.  Communication and coordination don't require typing.
- Accessible, fast, mouse-driven interface: no keys beyond those used in Half-life needed
- Simple to learn and play, it is hard-core action/strategy for a mainstream audience
- Innovative social dynamics lead to memorable games
- Emphasis on polish and atmosphere


Get connected to CVS again - DONE 4/3/01 

Get online backup working and right for new machine - DONE 4/3/01

Get samba working on new machine - DONE 4/3/01

Check-in all new code - DONE 4/3/01

Make HL look as good as Q3 (run tests with new gamma and Q3 textures) (ongoing)

Get game playable at a very basic level

	Add spectator mode
		+ Use tutorial - DONE 4/4/01 (still has a couple problems)
		- Add collision detection (not immediate priority)
		+ Add #spec_mode3, #spec_help and #spec_help2 to titles.txt - DONE 4/5/01
		+ How to exit spec mode?  Look how TFC handles enter, then do that for most keys.

	Ready room
		+ Create marine player, alien player (added class/team types instead 4/3/01)
		Menu to choose marine, alien or spectator mode
			Scratched menus, they are so nasty and convoluted.  Using real world metaphor to choose teams.
				+ Spawn in at avh_readyroom_start in "ready room".  Players are of indeterminate class (what's their model and stuff?  if default is used, we could have barneys, marines and aliens all in the ready room. :) )  - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Disable weapons, damage and death for players in ready room.  - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Public chatting and team chatting function identically in ready room.  Chat goes to everyone in casual mode, ready room and spectators only in tourny mode. - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Type out the MOTD when first joining the server (look into env_message and game_text entities) - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Presented with doors, one to join marine team, one to join aliens, one to auto-assign, one to spectate - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Choosing marines spawns you in at avh_marine_start, Choosing aliens spawns you in at avh_alien_start - DONE 4/6/01
				- Choosing spectator lets you spectate and talk with other spectators, not with people in game.  Attach light to spectators in non-tourny mode
				+ The marine and alien bases have a door to bring them back to the ready room... - DONE 4/6/01
				+ Revisit/cleanup concept of teams
				+ Allow any team mate to "purchase" a new teammate?  Ie, someone in spectator mode?
				+ When a player is in spectator mode with a future class set, don't allow spectator mode to free look and only allow follow of players of his team name
				- When in tournament mode, both the marine and alien doors close.  Respawns can still be purchased, but only from spectators that were just on a team.
				- Tournament mode could even be set by two switches, one at each base.  When both are set in the initial pre-game time, it is enabled. (sounds too easy for something so formal as a tournament mode)
				- When round restarts, spectators are spawned back in ready room so they can choose teams (if they chose a team and were put into spectator mode, try to spawn in on that team first)
				- Show tourny or casual mode on sign in ready room. (blinking "Tournament in progress")
				- Allow disabling of spectator mode, so the door closes and people can be recruited from the ready room.
				- Auto-assign door is disabled in tourny-mode
				- Bug: MOTD doesn't work on net clients
				+ Bug: Overbrightening not working on shodan
				+ Bug: Players not being damaged outside of ready room (casual/tourny ruleset)
				+ Rethink representation of rulesets - DONE	4/9/01

	Late joining 
		Terminology: 
			"Observer" = Cannot play this match, includes match documenter, commentator (observer cam)
			"Reinforcement" = Potentially was playing for a team, has indicated he wants to play on a specific team (fate cam)
		Objectives: People get to play as much as possible, while still remaining strategic and still having some tension about sitting out
		+ When marine or alien is chosen during pre-game, the team is joined immediately and the player spawns in
		+ When chosen mid-game, the player becomes a reinforcement, waiting to join that team.
		+ If auto-assign is chosen, the team with the fewest players/spectators is immediately set for that player's future team.
		+ In true spectator mode, specatators can watch both teams freely, but they're stuck as spectators.  When the next game starts, they'll get a message telling them to hit enter to play.  True spectators will always be true spectators for the round, they cannot join the marines or aliens.
		+ Reinforcements (those that are spectating because they died during play and couldn't respawn) can only watch their past/future teammates.  They can still leave and join in true spectator mode.
		+ In tourny mode, reinforcements can never become true spectators or join the other team.
		+ In casual mode, any player that has been a spectator cannot join any team until the next game
		+ Reinforcements can only start playing when purchased or a new match starts
		- In tourny play, reinforcements are only brought in when a teammate purchases them.  In casual play, the server will occasionally buy reinforcements for both sides simultaneously (for "free") if there exists compatible reinforcements.
		- When a player becomes a reinforcement and is waiting to play, all the players on that team get a message saying "Reinforcements available"
		- Show name of player on pie menu that will be brought in if a reinforcement is purchased?
		- Add sounds that play when different spawns are used, round starts and round ends?
		- Decrement points when calling in reinforcements
		+ Add client command for ending the round
		- Bug: Figure out why UTIL_Teletype isn't working (string issue?)
    	+ Only let pie menu be active when play mode == PLAYMODE_PLAYING

	Create ultra-basic level
		+ Starting points/zones/spawns
		- Model basic level (spend a few hours max, two bases, one hall/room to connect)

	Create entities at starting points
		- Entities
			+ Create new entities for alien spawns and marine spawns
			- Create entity that indicates starting "building"
			- Add code to use these spawns on death?

		- Create entity that specifies where "bases" can be built, create a default one
		- Check for draw as well (both teams lose within a couple seconds of each other)

	Game server update
		- Check for game victory: if all of a team's "buildings" are destroyed, that team loses
		- Audio/visual countdown before the game starts, so players know to make their choice.  Don't start counting until one player has joined each team, count avh_pregamelength after that.

	Implement base resource model
		+ Every player has point count
		+ Award points periodically
		+ Display current points on UI
		+ Add point cost to all equipment 
		+ Only allow purchase of equipment when legal
		- Only draw resource label when appropriate (fix "default text" as well)
		+ When a player dies, check if he has enough points to respawn.  If set, decrement them and do so.  If not, dump him into reinforcement mode.
		  - Change this to decrement off commander instead
		- Only draw resources if player role is squad leader or commander
		(omit: - Draw points in red if not enough to respawn with)

	User interface 
		+ Draw pie menu better so fonts are readable
		+ Fade in nodes again
		- Add ability to have spaces in text
		- Disable nodes that aren't currently being used, draw differently
		+ Draw point/info indicator somewhere for upgrades and weapons
		+ Draw point cost or hotkey next to it
		+ Later: Disable option when not enough points (!!)
		+ Change highlighted bar to follow chosen path
		+ Text isn't drawing (centered too)
		+ Fade out nodes better			   
		+ Space nodes differently in x and y
		+ Lines should draw to edge of text (or maybe nodes is ok if filling in background)
		o Lines should fade in (not sure FillRBGA can do this)
		- Draw lines to disabled nodes in disabled color
		+ Color of node should take into account whether selected or not
		+ After selecting a node, all nodes light up and they shouldn't
		+ Root node is white sometimes (argh, stupid vgui bug), FadingImageLabel to extend Panel instead and draw it's own background
		  X Increase size of bg image, make it oval and softer?  Center image.  Update 640 one too.
		  X New pie node artwork (can't have images)
		+ Space out nodes so there is room for lines between them
		+ Fix placement bugs that started happening after changing FadingImageLabel to extend Panel
		+ Fix it not popping up the first time 
		+ Make it artificially taller (hard-code constanter bigger than just text height)
		+ It's almost centered but not quite
		+ Add tons of new impulses for all new actions, then hook 'em up
		+ Fix bug where first time it's up it's in the wrong place
		+ Add in other pie menus for other roles
		+ Fix bug were the pie menu doesn't come up the first time...always!
		+ Fix bug where SetRsrces is coming before the HUD is initlialized, sometimes
		+ Disable Resources label when appropriate
		- Grow hit area around it so it's easier to use
	
	Misc
		+ Only allow player death when appropriate (while playing the game and after the game has started)
		- When siege turret hits something, create nice siege splash effect
		- Only have siege turret able to hit a target that it or a teammate can see (so no cloaking)
		- Change decals for organic weapons (they are bullet holes right now)

	Add team scoreboard
		- Show teams on each side
		- Show relevant info (ping, rounds played, no frags, etc)

	Top-down UI
		- Starcraft mini-map is 34% of screen height, 25% of screen width
		- Center is 25% of height for roughly 50% of middle of screen
		- Right side is 25% of width, 31%
		- Changing mouse cursor for marquee (!), one for minerals/gas
		- Don't allow scrolling when marquee selecting

	Predict gun-empty sound. gEmptySoundEventID


Maxim:
	"Don't write any code you won't use."
	- mouse dragging in HUD
	- generic weapon config
	- chain of command in many ways

To make the game playable
-------------------------
  + Enhance pie menu with touching cells
	+ Added quick select mode all
  - Key bindings:
	+ Remove 1,2,3,4,5 commands
	+ Add commands for primary weapon, secondary weapon, use equipment?  (think this through, maybe just next weapon for now)
	- Fix use item commands to use light, use heavy, use other
	- Scratched all 
  + for now, purchased weapons just use the crap weapons that are in there now
  - Add entities that set your desired role
    - Need to draw text when role changed "When game starts you will be a squad leader"
    - Game starts 15 seconds after each team has at least one person.  needs audio/visual countdown (right now you type 'startgame' at the console)
	- When a role is chosen, display message that summarizes the role to the player
  + Expand test level to be somewhat playable (make three times the size with more spawns) (use marinestart7?)
  + Fix draw text commands so all these messages show up
    + Revamped messages, now they use titles.txt correctly and nothing is hard-coded
	+ Messages for motd, marine roles, observer mode and more are now in
  - Ammo...what to do about it?  
	+ Rework weapons a bit so they have ammo, clips, reload, etc.
	+ How about buying an ammo pack that can be dropped and given normally.
	- Make sure reload command works (plays sound, animation, takes a little time)
  + Make deployable mines (claymores)
    + Deploy like claymore on wall
	+ Deploy like mine on floor (<45 degrees) (no beam)
	+ Doesn't go off for teammate, emits beeping sound instead.
	+ Fix beeping so it doesn't go off until mine is active, and not too often
	- Make mines not cause displace you (so you can't get stuck)
	+ Make beams not break for friendlies
  - Make a deployable turret
	+ Design, make class
	+ Deploy it correctly, visually
	- Fix collision problems
	- Ammo?  Damage?  Attribute resources correctly on a kill
	+ Does it need to be built before activated?  Probably want this so turrets can't instantly be bought and deployed.
	+ Better sounds (added hooks, sounds just need to be replaced)
  + Refactor current team in AvHPlayer
  + Refactor creation and dropping of ammo
  - Bug: Turrets/marines/shotguns aren't hurting players
  + Bug: Can't select mines
  - HUDs for each class
	- draw current health
	- draw resources, if applicable
	- get mouse dragging working again to customize nicely (use when all components hidden) (if easy to get working)
  + Add concept of weight for everything that can be added to inventory.  Weight changes your max speed.  Carrying multiple weapons works differently though: only add the weight of the heaviest weapon you carry.
    X add bool to panel that is debug only, never draw components that have debugonly set when this client variable is set
    X add label that shows current weight, current top speed (debug only)
	+ Print out current weight and speed when it changes
  X After purchasing equipment, have concept of "held item"
    - Allow "held item" to be dropped
	  - Add a (blinking?) message on HUD that says "Holding <itemname>.  Touch a player to give it to them."
	  - Fill in pie menu entry to switch between DynDropPurchase to Drop <itemname>
	- If leader touches soldier (only in his squad?) (not the soldier touching the leader!) then the equipment is given to the player.
	- If the equipment is given, display message to leader and soldier indicating equipment was given.
	- If the player can't take it, display message to leader and soldier explaing why it couldn't be given.
    - Don't allow purchases until "held item" is dropped or given
	- This has changed to just buy and drop the item at once.  Less control but a lot easier to add.
  X Commander is on the ground like the other roles for now
  X Allow leaders to pick up equipment if they aren't holding an item
  - Bring in reinforcements automatically (for now)
  - For now, there are no separate squads.  All marines report to all squads (this can change later, just get it working!)
  - Resources on kill:
	+ Calculate how many points a kill was worth
	+ Split points between squad leader and commander
	- Display message to player indicating: "your squad just just earned X points for your side"
	- Feedback to leader: "your squad just got x points". Very important not to display to squad leader who got the points. 
	- Feedback to commander: "DarkBunny's squad just earned x points".  Very important to show commander which _squad_ got the points. Rewards squad efficiency, not player efficiency.
  - Weapons
	+ Get shotgun functional
	- Flamethrower
		- Think long and hard about how to do this 
		+ Talk to Brian about it
		+ Finish up particle systems so the look good and and relatively bugfree
			- Get shotgun puff looking great (waiting for cory)
			+ Get light dust cloud looking great (waiting for cory)
			+ Fix particle shaking problem
			+ Fix orientation of particles (test in observer mode too)
			+ Fix particle systems not being added to full pack unless they have a model
			+ Fix cone coming in at angle
			O Fix "using" problems so they work well as button/use targets (also fix problem where other particle systems turn off)
			+ Fix problem where events/particles don't fire every once in a while
			+ Make sure .ps can do everything that avh_particles_custom can do (flags come to mind)
			- Experiment particle/zbuffering interactions
			+ Fix slowdown
			+ Fix particle problems when loading a second map 
				+ Reset server template list
				+ Reset client template list
				+ Clear all particle systems from manager
				+ Reload map
				+ Resend templates
	O Add knife weapon

  + Remove squad leader (8/8/01)
	+ Add weapon buying for commander
	+ Add team_command entity for entering and leaving commander mode
	+ Fix up so you don't lose your weapons when moving between command mode and ground
	+ Move marines to completely team resources
	+ Revisit rewards for killing enemys, give team points for marines, individual points for aliens
	+ Marines spend points out of team pool

  - Movement modes
	+ Jetpack
		+ Get basics working
		+ Fix prediction weirdness with fakelag
		+ Add blue dlight
			+ on client
			+ on server
		+ Add sound that plays
			+ on client
			+ on server
		+ Bug: why doesn't the effect play locally depending on weapon you're holding?
		- Add smoke spray out bottom
		- Add jetpack as attachable model
		- Modify jetpack so wishvel is taken into account, like flight
		
  + Test for victory
	+ Victory mode where it says "x team wins" (it's got to be better than this, esp. given the longer length of games)
	+ When victory mode ends, reset level and put everyone back in the ready room

  - Optimization: check into marking func_waypoint and such with FL_DORMANT so they aren't updated to client ever

  + Tone down alien speeds (8/8/01)
  ? Lower marine speeds just a little for Lost Temple timing results
  + Have less differentiation for equipment (8/8/01)

  - Placing buildings from top down mode
	+ Need placement of turrets, phase gates, siege turrets (so models, or particle systems)
	+ Desirable to have same code running on client and server, so put it AvHSharedUtil?
	+ Maybe this is the same code that traces for right-click?  It traces down to a avh_groundfloor?
	+ If the client determines a successful placement, it sends request to server
	+ Client can put it down immediately, server must send back error to delete it if it wasn't valid (sends message with "turret bought, or turret cancelled")
	+ Get phase gate sound looping
	O Get turrets rotating after placement
	+ Add siege turret
		+ Fix them so they fire
		+ Add new effect when getting hit
		+ Slow ROF, warm-up time
		+ Minimum range
	- Add camera tower
		+ Have the resources affect incremental resources
		- Have the resources affect kills
		+ Set default incremental resource rate to 0
		- Add health to camera tower so it can be destroyed

   O Change how weldables look to the welder-wielding player
   O Better sounds for turrets, let siege have different sound effects than regular turrets
   - Make all buildings solid and fully built in testing mode, buildable in non-testing mode
   + Fix siege turrets to fire again
   - AvHCameraTower should take damage

Ideas from Damon and Greg on camping trip:
- Commander micro:
	- Allow commander to use power-ups, like originally intended (they cost maybe 1 pt each time they're used, they're all part of level 1 weapons research)
	- Let commander build hunter seeker scout thing that he can move around.  It doesn't path, just simple moves.  It cloaks when still, but only provides LOS when not cloaked.
	- Allow aliens to mass by getting picking up eggs off walls of hive and dropping them like dropping a weapon.  When a marine comes within a certain distance, the egg opens and an alien attacks.  After that tha elien goes back to his post and ventures within a certain distance to engage enemies.  Allows aliens to rush, or keep them for defense.
	- Damon doesn't like multiple commanders, conflicting orders
	- Damon loves the idea of commanders turning turrets, because they can only be effective in a 90 degree angle or so

Tasks before trying to have a real game of marines vs. marines (6+ people)
  - Soldiers, general
    + Weapon switching and showing your current inventory clearly
    + Reloading
    + Squad promotion and demotion
	+ Fixed client-side prediction errors with weapons (make sure not to use random numbers anywhere!)
    - The concept of armor, and heavy armor
    - HUDs showing health, ammo, current weapon, armor, etc
		+ health
		- armor
		+ ammo
	+ CS hooks to let you play on a CS map
	- Smoke puffs and other feedback for weapons
    - Flamethrower
    - Overwatch
    + Welding gun
	  + Shell/boilerplate code
	  + Weapon effects
		+ One for welding near nothing
		+ One for welding an object (smoke, hot glow).  Use also for attacking.
	  + New entity that represents a weldable item
	  + When firing, check if any weldables are in the area.  If not, check for target directly in front of us.
	  + If welding, increase percentageBuilt by rate dictated by welder and build time of entity

    - Welder repairs armor, with status bar
	- Show message when near something can be welded, draw line towards it too
	+ Get heavy machine gun back in 
	- New resource model (#4)
	- Increase checking rate of claymores
	- Revamp marine role messages
	+ Fix observer targets

    + Chain of command
		- Allow marines to defect
		- Player can only become commander when there is at least one squad leader.  If at the start of a round there are no leaders, change any commander to leader
		- ...

	+ Get player models working correctly for each marine, alien and ready room state

	- Commanding
		- Commander has no body
		- Draw every player name on HUD (COC) with leaders at top, soldiers indented below
			- Draw box around current squad, depending which is selected
			+ When player is firing, draw blinking icon next to his name
			- When player is being attacked, draw blinking icon next to his name
			+ When player sees lifeform, highlight his name
			- Draw player names in color that represents his health
			- General LOS: Draw blips when near marines, don't draw elsewhere.  When an enemy is in view of a marine, draw it normally (add to PVS)

    - Resources allocated correctly, due to squad

    - New player models
    - Grenades (they should check to make sure they have a clear line to target before doing damage, so they can be used to clear hall while in cover near it)
    	- gas
	    - frag

  - Leaders
	+ All bought items dropped

  - Fully develop commander role and communication between him and teammates
	- Added "Enemy spotted" and "Requesting orders" for non-commanders
	- Give automatic orders that speak to players "build objective", "weld objective", "guard player", "pick up weapon"
	- Make it SUPER-clear what your order is.  This is one of the big reasons why this approach hasn't worked in the past.  My mom should know what to do and where to go.
	- Add tons of elevators, doors, buttons, switchable lights, this stuff seems great for commander
	- Draw waypoints in yellow when given, green when acknowledged.  Yellow waypoints expire after 10 seconds or so (or when "negative")
	- Definitely add powerups, they will transform the game
	- Draw enemy hive locations on mini-map, draw visible enemies as red dots as well
	- The commander can sometimes see red blips on the main view, that doesn't mean they are drawn on the mini-map
	- Make aliens move much slower (except scout aliens?) so the micro-ing is useful for marines?
	- Add localized description names for each func_waypoint so we can transmit orders like "guard location in the garage", or it speaks "guard location", then blinks arrow and shows "Move to the garage, acknowledge to accept"
	- Communicate sub-menu sends trebley voice comms down to selected players (except taunt and a couple global ones)
	- double-tap 1 jumps to squad 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3

  - Test teams by adding console command that changes renderfx for every entity in the world to yellow for neutral, blue for team1, red for team2
  - How to show what can be welded
  - Try to add graphical HUD for top-down using sprites
  - Add power bar for jetpack and flight
  + Velocity doesn't break cloaking, only user movement and attacking!
  + Add entity that lets commander go into top down mode

  Less important:
  - Voice acks at start and stop of many actions
  - Commander  
    - Phase gate
    - Adrenaline
    - Def matrix
    - Camera tower/resource building
    - Siege turret

  - Blaze of glory (or something in its place)
  - Life support
  - Nuke gun (save until last because it may not fit in the menu if the chain of command doesn't work)
  - Promity sensor?
  - At beginning of round: (commander player) "Are you ready to give your life for your team?" (all players at slightly different pitches/timings/voices) "Sir, yes sir!"
  - Nearby chat
  - Laser designator
  - Ability to mark a target location or person
  - Buy item, hold it, then give it to next player you touch
  - Accuracy system: less accurate the faster you're moving (what's this trying to promote?)
  - Good first map (using existing map pieces as a start)
  - TODO: Override int CHud :: MsgFunc_Damage to really customize damage feedback, ala Carmack!
  - Automatic shoulder lights

Finalize mapping technology build
	- Add gamma entity
		- Make sure it restores when game crashes 
		+ Make sure it works correctly when map changes
		+ Remove ToggleGamma() and command
		+ Allow tweaking of gamma in mapper build only?  Only if cheats enabled?
		+ Allow tweaking of particle systems in mapper build only?  Or only if special command line parameter?  Only if cheats enabled?
		- Include in docs how to modify screenshot using Photoshop using your gamma
		- Add screen shot capability using PunkBuster stuff?
	O Remove lots of stuff so it's totally unplayable
	X Get view entity height working correctly
	- Make start/stop commander mode work right, also don't show special commander HUD
	- Fix up welding so it looks right on ground and in top-down view, also bring down number and size of particles and test on Shodan for peformance
	- Finish documentation 
		+ Rework visuals, add particle editing docs, update in a big way
		- Add section on hacker mode and how to use it (must wait until public release)
		- Update commander mode entities (must wait until public release)
	- Finalize hacker mode stuff (ie, tweak collision and feedback)
	- Fix particle system normal problem
	O Have many less assets to keep build small (create formal asset list?)
	- Create docs on how to setup Worldcraft for use with it?
	- Have separate mapper IDs, up until the mapper build becomes public
	- Fix/remove LOS stuff
	X Rename all entities to ns_?
	O Convert all .rmfs over to NS entities
	+ Add listps command that lists particle systems
	O Remove support for <mapname>.ps?
	- Test triggers that are in place when game starts.  Remove trigger_ entities like ns_casualmode_enable?
	+ Rename "specialsound" entity
	+ Remove or add to glow entity
	- Make sure order-giving works through multiple ground floor entities so we can have walkways
	+ Rename ground floor to whatever Crinity/I decided to call it
	- Finish sample level and all issues that go with it
		+ Fix r_speeds with ceilings
			- Incorporate into mapping guidelines
		+ Fix func_waypoints...finally!
		+ Water not showing up in top-down mode (are all entities being culled in top-down mode?)
		+ can't cancel building anymore
		+ Not smoothly scrolling anymore
		+ Fix performance problem on _ground_ (top down works great)...func_seethrough, func_waypoint or clip brushes?
		+ Get rid of random water effects?
		- Add more shared experience stuff
		+ Add hacker-mode stuff for commander
		- Fix upper right corner
		+ Add ready room
		+ Add at least one particle system

	+ Add periodic message indicating that game won't start until both teams have players
	+ Update victory conditions to end whenever either team has no non-commander players with points and ability to respawn
	+ Remove outdated console commands, move couple hard-coded ones into constants
	+ Add end game as loss sound
	+ Add knife sooner rather than later
	- Add recoil system for weapons
	- Make base movement without machine gun a bit faster (so going naked is more beneficial)

Alien playable goals
  + Figure out alien interface...pie menu?  Gestural stuff?  RMB as special?	Multiple weapons via HUD?
  - Design interface and upgrade system
	+ Rework pie menu a bit to allow sprite nodes and connectors
	- Fix pie menu to clip vertical connectors correctly
	- Add leaf node sprite nubs
	- Make spit a ball that collides, not a point
	- Get alien weapons to show up on HUD, play a different sound when selecting and choosing
	- Get alien weapons to be predicted correctly, something's wrong
  - Morphing and upgrade system
	- Designed and mostly implemented
	- Make upgrades take time?  Become an egg when morphing up to other lifeforms?
	+ Give aliens some basic attacks so they can fight
  + Hive mind structure that spawns in at random avh_hive_start point
  + Spit weapon
  - Dark swarm/gas
  - Melee attack for level one
  - Fix up flight
	- Add effects
  - Fix up wall jumping
	- Add effects
  - Fix up gliding
  - Web?
  - Wall running (big task I think)
  X Egg laying for spawn points
  - Acceleration, charging for artlu (takes awhile to get top speed)
  - Player hulls for different size aliens
  - Universal upgrades
	+ Exoskeleton - Armor upgrade
	+ Phermones - Increases movement speed 
	+ Regeneration - All aliens heals damage and armor over time 
	- Infravision - Player can see heat, even through world geometry (humans only for now...generators, phase gates, firing weapons? placeable heat entities so humans can hide out?) 
	+ Cloaking - When alien stands still, he fades to near invisibility. Aliens remain cloaked when attacking but not while moving. 
	- Acid blood - When alien takes damage, he inflicts damage on reflection of attack. Can hurt fellow aliens when team damage is on. 
	- Allow upgrading multiple abilities at once?
  - Alien language/taunting
  - Whenever an alien attacks and hits ANY player, he squeals and his adrenaline goes up
  - Unified hive mind system
	+ Basic system (including for marine side!)
	- Draw it better so it's easier to tell the range (fade it?)
  - Ideas for alien weapons: 
	- power up move that makes a sound, then attacks all players in range (like the electricity guys and blink dogs in Half-life)
	- an alien ability that can be used to bring another alien back to life?
	- some sort of gambling type, double or nothing ability.  Each time you use it, you get pumped up more (faster, more damage, etc.) but you lose points of your current AND max health


Bigger tasks
	- Nice scoreboard
		- Basic system (teams, colors, schemes)
			- going to ready room should change team to 0
			- Draw team 0 at bottom
			- Allow mouse to become visible when scoreboard is up (disable pie menu)
			O Colors
	- Player ID system
	- Sniping
	- Stim pack and other commander abilities
	- Feedback for melee attacks
	- Disable tech buttons when not allowed
	- Fixup egg laying
	- High jump, wall jump
	- Growing melee
	- Rework visible orders
	- Regen near hive, get ammo near hive
	- Friendly fire issues (make sure it works correctly in tournament mode, non-tournament mode)
	- "stop-hit", "pull-back" and affecting velocity when hit by weapons
	- Heat for marine weapons
	- Charging (costs adrenaline, but you'll get it back if you hit!)
	- Primal scream (adrenaline)
	- Test commander blips
	- Revisit tech tree and upgrades
	- Voting system
	- Turret solidity and build bug
	- Make commander waypoints more clear in FP view
	- Volumetrics (grenades and flamethrower)
	- Eggs that visibly morph into creature

Little tasks (bugs, small improvements)
	+ Lower gravity for flying only when jump is held down (allows gliding down)
	- Allow WASD scrolling in top down mode
	- Make sure area is big enough for gestation
	- Fixup selection of welder and grenades
	- Fixup grenades
	- "Press a key to continue" when screen blocks during death


Possible features
  - draw health and more in observer mode?

Ways to play:
  - save money, use points for respawns
  - seal up the place with welder, buy time, drop resource buildings

After watching Cory:
  + "Build turret" buys it and starts building it
  + "Next weapon" should be disabled when appropriate
  + Mousewheel should cycle weapons
  + Type out message: Activate the turret by pressing your "use" key on it.  Say this whenever you're near an unbuilt turret, not just after buying one!
  + Bug: enemies aren't displaying message when killed

After watching Nate
  - Put ladders in corners or near obstacles so they can't easily be overshoot when trying to use 
  - 

Other stuff
  - How to know whether your team is "winning"?
  - When near a turret (or holding a turret before placing), draw circle showing it's area of effect
  - How to look at another player and know their role and relation to you?
  - Put chain of command back in
	- Update to not use experience level but desired role
	- Draw much smaller, use small font to do so
    - Find bugs in it
  - Manual reinforcements
  - Sudden death mode where reinforcements aren't allowed after a certain point
  - team scoreboard when holding tab
  - ammo/healing (?)
  - audio/visual victory, then observers/reinforcements respawn in ready room, those in game stay in the game
  - basic level using new entities with ready room and two bases
  Deferred/No longer needed:
    - visual effects while building bases (you have to "use" the building kind of like the HEV recharge stations.  after you use it long enough, it comes online and starts humming.  multiple people can help to build it faster.  I want the building to fade into view.  also lets people have non-combat builder roles, esp. if allowing repair, or skilled building)
    - ability to destroy bases to reduce resource intake (not working for some reason) 
    - equipment can be purchased any time but is only given when near/touching base (promotes falling back and planning)
  First-person reaver-like cannon for aliens, can hit clusters, can outrange turrets, sneak past mines/trips
	- Maybe have it do more damage to closer the target is?  So it can outrange stuff but takes longer, or get really close for high-impact
  Aliens need weapons that require cleverness and have neat side effects
	- Things like blowing up ammo, affecting speed, damage multipliers, limpets, shooting projectiles that you can view from
  Add lines to trace along to weld?  Damn that'd be cool....

+ Write documentation that describes how to build levels using these entities

- Incorporate Zassert into rest of game

- Before MOD expo application
	- New cursors (just waiting for Jason)
	- New commander UI, polishing and tweaking for 1024x768
	- Fix cursor behavior over commander UI
	- Order giving (only if movie being made)
	- Drawing orders better in first-person
	O Pretty up marine UI (resources/reinforcements...hide for now?)
	- Implement colorful and helpful mini-map
		- Design and get working
		- Add hooks for map-makers to customize?  Specify minimum width/height for important entities so they show up?
		- Add minimum view height to shading is right?
		- Now that the aspect ratio is preserved, fix AvHTeamHierarchy
	- Spruce how how marines look when selected
		- Added spinning model that is colored according to player health
	- Alien view model
	- Take screenshots Tuesday night with mini-playtest

- Before MOD expo
	- Fix every single crash
	+ Add func_useables entity so commander doesn't have to click tiny buttons, he can click on the entities themselves!

---------
- NSTR2 - 
---------
O Token too long bug
	- Into docs: instructions for converting particle systems:
		1. Get a recent .map version of your .rmf.  Do this by exporting your .rmf if needed.  If this .map was last exported using the previous ns.fgd, you can skip step #3.
		2. Open up your .map in a text edtior like notepad.
		3. Search for env_particles_custom.  Delete any lines that you see any of the following lines in:
			- "particlesMaxAlpha"

O Hulls.txt for CSG
- Welder, welding
	- Feedback showing what is weldable
- Particle lifetime bug (Merks)
	- the slider for particle system lifetime doesnt have a -1 setting, so if you edit a ps with a lifetime, and then edit one which is set to never die, then it uses the current value on the slider for the PS lifetime
<Merkaba> and of course once its died, u cant get it back again

Effective micromanagement
  Ideas about making micro-management as powerful as possible.

  1. When the commander issues an attack order, his target's location is revealed to him, even if he can't see the target and even as it moves (because 
  the soldier will see the waypoint on his HUD).

  2. I'm thinking of adding a "stimpack" type abiliity, where the currently selected player(s) gain speed (and maybe a damage bonus, ala Starcraft) for a 
  short time.  This would probably cost points instead of health, not sure.  Of course, if it cost something else other then points, that would encourage the 
  commander to micro even more.  The hard part is not making it prone to abuse.  If it costs health, a dickhead commander could kill off his team.

  3. There is a full LOS in NS, so that means the commander can only see enemy units and structures when he's got a "unit" on the ground that can see it.  Otherwise, 
  it's not drawn.  Currently though, the commander can sometimes see "blips" that his players can't see.  This happens when a player is close to an enemy player 
  or structure but can't see it.  The commander can still issue orders to these blips and can act accordingly.

  4. I'm thinking of some way the commander can mark areas as dangerous...like maybe he could quickly mark the mouth of a ventilation shaft as dangerous, 
  so the commander can use his knowledge of the environment to help players he's nearby.

  5. Maybe if a player hits the unit/building he's targetting, it can acquire a "lock" and he'll do more damage?  This is a bit artificial-sounding but this 
  could really go a long way towards effective microing.

  6. The commander can "drop" weapons, ammo and possibly healthpacks to players.  These items phase in almost instantly.

  7. Possibly an ability the commander can research to allow a player to become invulnerable (but maybe immobile also?) for a short time.

  8. Phase gates can be dropped in, providing a quick escape for players.

  What I'm really looking for here is a way for the commander to affect the outcome of a combat.  Like in Starcraft, there's this great thing where 
  you're constantly telling units to attack, run away, marine dance, attack new targets as they become visible, etc.  You're always assessing combat too, 
  so you know whether to retreat or not.  In NS, that doesn't exist yet, but I think it will with some more work.  All the player move speeds are a bit 
  slower then most FPS games, so troops can be deployed with intention, people aren't just running the map wildly and also so the commander can actually select 
  players and give orders.


From Shackes:

http://www.shackes.com/articles/cpl_recap.html
"The only really viable professional game on the horizon is Warcraft 3, and that's not an fps. Because of that, the CPL is probably going to be "stuck" 
with Counter-Strike for awhile. Doom 3 and Quake 4 are a long way away. So where do we go now?"

"The best thing that can happen over the next year of the CPL-CounterStrike relationship is to see the Counter-Strike community mature into something that 
has stable clans and a plethora of players that are committed to being professional gamers, regardless of platform. That way, when a new CPL-worthy game comes 
out there will be a huge community of clans and players that will compete hard at it. The serious Quake players and the serious Counter-Strike players, ideally, 
will merge into one thing and the core community will balloon. Gamers will be unified, and the competition will be fierce. "


- From DOD map submission guidelines:
	WADS and textures: 
	ALL textures will be inlcuded in either the .bsp file, or in a wad file with the SAME NAME AS THE MAP. No textures will be included in this .wad that are not in the map. The map will not point to other WAD files, only it's personal wad file. 
	
	MODELS, SOUNDS, and SPRITES: 
	ALL map models will go in: 
	half-life/dod/models/mapmodels/ 
	ALL sprites will go in: 
	half-life/dod/sprites/mapsprites/ 
	Sounds will go in a subdirectory of: 
	half-life/dod/sounds/ 
	This subdirectory will have the same name of the map. So, each map will have its own 
	directory for sounds. 
	
	NO DEFAULT DOD SOUNDS, MODELS, OR SPRITES WILL BE REPLACED BY MAP SUBMISSIONS. 
	This includes flag models. If your objective system uses flags, then use the flags included with dod - No 600 poly waving flags that everyone seems to use. If a non-flag model is used for objectives, that's fine - as long as it's not high-poly. 
	
	NO INSTALLER FILES PLEASE. We here at the dod team know how to unzip a file! You don't need to include a useless installer that takes up extra space and clutters our program menu 
	with uninstall options! Just put your files in zip format, preferably unzippable to /dod/, not /half-life/. 
	
	Do not clutter your map submissions with useless filler! File size will be a MAJOR consideration in what maps we choose - if a file is too large, or not CRUCIAL to your map, leave it out or cut it down! (i.e., you don't need a 2 meg sound file to play during different points of the map!) 
	
	If you use sounds, textures, or models from ANY OTHER GAME OR MOD, you must note it in your readme.txt. If we catch people using textures from other games, and we're not told about it by the mapper, we won't hesitate a second to remove your map from 2.0 consideration. 
	
	BE WARNED: We have ALOT of submissions, so if your map submission doesn't follow these rules carefully, it probably won't even be put into testing rotation. 



Features not to forget
- Blend on server, animation.cpp: "Like Adrian said, if you're doing custom player model blending on the client, you need to mirror that blending on the server or your hitboxes will not match." Digest, Vol #247 and #248
- Locational damage
- Recoil
- Medic role
- Add something a stationary marine can do for fun, to encourage waiting for orders instead of running off, when the commander's attention is elsewhere?
- Viewing health/ammo as commander
- Speaking to only selected players
- Players being slowed down when hit
- Slowing down marines
- Non-active items don't weigh as much (ala CS)
- Comm sat/scanner sweep
- Increase speed of spectators, big time
- Limit spectators to box in map
- Some way to prevent players from quitting the game, then coming back in on the other team as a reinforcement (track IPs of players that joined a game.  If they leave the server and try to come back, don't let them back in until game finishes?)
- Display # of reinforcements ("empty slots", or the ability to join the team) on the scoreboard while in the ready room?  Only allow auto-join after game starts?
- Marines slowing down when really wounded
- Check Tribes to get a really clear waypoint
- "trickjumps" for aliens
- Design a way for events to happen (needed for real community)
- Published skill levels for servers (more fun for all, anti-cheating too, but requires admins)
+ user.scr and settings.scr
- Spraypaint images
	+ Call for action
	- Look through, collate, test in game
	- Add to .final wad
- Profile and optimize network usage
	X CS seems to use about 1.5k in and out generally, NS is around double that (even with just one player) -- CORRECTION: This was when running the server and is comparable to CS actually

	- Add Merk's recent post to mapping guidelines
		- As everyone should know, the level 1 alien (Bob) is able to climb walls, and sit on ceilings. There is a small problem concerning this, due to the way halflife determins the brightness of a model. It takes the brightness setting by looking at the floor directly below it, meaning that if your ceiling is in darkness, but your floor is brightly lit, an alien sitting on the ceiling will also be brightly lit. This, of course, poses a problem. It might only be a temporary problem as it could be that Flay finds a way to take the brightness from the wall the alien is attached to, but for the mean time, be cautioned that dark ceilings and bright floors aren't a good mix.
		- In various places of Hera, I have pipes/girders running along the ceiling but leaving a 64 unit gap or so above them, so aliens can run along them without being seen, and having the correct light level applied to them. This of course also means the pipe has to be made a func_seethrough (Unless its not a large obtrusion), but that shouldn't be a problem.
		- The level 5 alien is a large creature, which means that it can only travel through large corridors. I suggest you try and at the least have a direct route between all 3 hive rooms which is large enough for the level 5 to pass through. Also bear in mind, though, that marines must have at least a 30 second walk between the hives. (unless they have jetpacks/welder, which can be used to open up / take alternative routes, if you do so wish to implement such a strategy in your map.)
	- Fix in mapping guidelines: The caveats with the line of sight computations: sounds and weapon effects are still played for the commander normally. This means the commander can still deduce information about an area that he can't see. If he's hovering over a ventilation shaft with a noisy alien inside, he'll be able to hear the alien if he's close enough. If the alien fires, the commander will see his weapon effect, but not the alien itself

		- NOTE: The order is important.  I play animations by their offsets.  For consistency, let's keep all the building animation names the same.  $include these animations to they are all the same.
		- spawn (1 frame, not really animated, closed-looking)
		- deploy (blends from spawn to idle, can take .5 - 2 seconds) (I play generic deploy sound, we will probably move to sound events on deploy later)
		- idle (blends from deploy, optional)
		- idle2 (blends from deploy, optional)
		- researching (pistons moving, spewing smoke, etc. Looping.)
		- active (spawning reinforcement for infantry portal, creating alien for hive, most will be empty.  If you don't know if it should loop or not, make it loop.)
		- fire (turret, siege turret, most buildings won't need this.  Looping.)
		- die forward
		- die left
		- die backward

O Changed primal scream HUD color to green instead of red (people were getting rightly confused about their weapons being unuseable), bug #165
O Removed "bodysplat" sound when level 1 falls a long distance (bug #142)
O Added code to detect that a level has the right amount of spawns.  This information is printed to the console on level load. (bug #187, bug #169, bug #112)
O Weird "underwater" issues for commander above hera landing pad (bug #49)
O Removed use of "model" command (set the model every tick) (bug #211)
	- TODO: Also remove default model in RR?
O Addressed commander crashing when selecting things (bug #173)
- Added mp_teamresourcehandicap (if set to 1, biases team with less players with extra resources) (bug #202)
	O Changed func_resource to represent resources as a float
- Fixed problem where selection effects sometimes draw after leaving command station (bug #219)
- Bite and spit started could go through walls, as their attacks emanated too far from the player origin (bug #177)
O Reduced spike damage for level 3 (bug #207)
O Don't auto-switch to an empty weapon (bug #194)
O Fixed bug where particle systems weren't being reset properly after a game end, causing wrong or no particles to emit (bug #125)
O Increased spike energy cost by 25%
O Spent a long time narrowing down the jiggling while standing on buildings, it's in Valve's court at the moment
	- Got e-mail back from Yahn, now investigate
O New smaller mine artwork (still a bit floaty)
O Fixed crash when placing tripmines on doors (bug #222)
O Fixed command station healing players (also, retain armor value) (bug #137)
O Started addressing cheating (leap exploit to start) though it's not fixed yet. You should hear a beep ("invalid.wav") when the game detects that you're doing something illegal, though it doesn't do anything about it yet.  Validated selection, research, building, hotgroups, lifeform morphing, upgrade evolution, etc.) (bug #118)  
O Primal scream duration and cost increased significantly, for a more game-altering moment (bug #205)
O Closed bug #101 (blinking no longer goes through walls)
O Don't white-out commander when nukes detonate (bug #91)
O Closed out ladder-speed bug (bug #28)
O Fixed melee attacks not working up or down (bug #117)
- func_buttons now reset properly (bug #4)
	- Lots of stuff has changed reset-wise, but some lifts and doors don't reset right anymore, others work better
O Reworked marine weapons to add randomness to their shots (Machine gun, pistol, shotgun, HMG) (bug #236)
O Increased pistol damage from 18 to 25
O Redemption tweaks (it triggers more often, it won't pull you back if you have no hives, plays a "invalid" sound when it tries to pull you back but you have no hives, it will now pull you back even if not in combat) (bug #238)
O Removed sickness-inducing view shakes when hit with melee, but not taking damage, anti-llama (bug #230)
O Builder healing spray damage/healing increased from 15 to 20
O HMG damage increased from 22 to 28 and range increased about 20% (now that it has such a wide spray)
- Added ready room command and commander voting to pop-up menu so console should never have to be used (bugs that will be fixed not withstanding)
O Added temporarily invulnerable time (default is .1 minutes -> 6 seconds).  Players glow their team color during this time and can't be hurt. (bug #237)
	- TODO: Draw this on view model as well
O Fixed commander ability to change weapons (!) (bug #239)
O Fixed marine progress indicators not always showing up after a map change (bug #24)
O New buggy behavior: the command menu now longer works for MOUSE2!  The code is half-way to being fixed, need to work with Valve on this.  Bind it to a key in the meantime, sorry!
O Moved soldier info_location out of minimap and to bottom of screen for consistency and to get around problems where it doesn't line up under different resolutions
O Fixed bug where hitting "use defaults" in control setup would delete your settings
O Overflow and HUD lag issues
	O Disable network buffering to see if that's the HUD latency (set to -1)
	O Log all network traffic by default
	O HUD lag should be gone from now on, but we might see more overflows
O Addressed various respawning issues (the problem will now be easier to find if it's not fixed).  Respawning changed significantly, (though it should behave the same), so be on the lookout for spawning problems.
O New command center model!  I think you'll agree with me that this rules.  Thanks Squeal and Mojo!
O New armory model!  Newly animated as well.  Looks different for the basic and the advanced versions.  Thanks Erex and Mojo!
O New HMG model!  Animated and sized properly now (I need to change some code to make the fire animation look right).  Thanks BathroomMonkey and DefOne!
O A bunch of new sound effects (xenocide, spit, blink, refilling at armory, grenade bounce, shotty, siege, spores, more)
O New version of ns_nancy!
O First version of ns_shaft from Ekaj!
O New version of ns_tanith from tommyd!
O New MUSIC!  This is a fairly significant milestone for us.  This is official music for NS.  There's more on the way.  Please do NOT give this to anyone under any circumstances, we are keeping it quiet right now.


RC3
---
O Fixed marine build sound looping occasionally, divine wind looping sound problem, sample conversion warnings in console (bug #270)
- Post post-installation image guidelines
O Fixed hearing voice comm of enemies when dead (bug #274)
O Fixed missing chat while dead (bug #280)
O Fixed victory condition issue (bug #171)
- Capture good overflow and performance logging
	- Figure out cause of overflows
		O Looks like network messages are being added faster then they can be sent...this is a big problem
		O Removed errant "Battery" message!
		- Looks like bullet decals could be a problem too...if all marines are firing LMGs and missing, 10 bullets a second*13*bytes*16 players
			- Remove bullet decals first
			- Removed texture sounds playing on server and client
		- Bots marked returning TRUE for IsNetClient(), fix this too
O Toned down level 5 stepsize (bug #255)
O Workaround for -console problems on NVIDIA cards (bug #269)
O Add spike hit sounds
	O Added graphical effect back in for spikes also
- Optimization: don't send particles to a player that already has them on a game reset
O Fix ambient sound problems (bug #126)
O Fix particle visible particles (bug #127, bug #216)
- Write Chuck Olson about imminent build
- Write ArsTechnica
- Write N@rby's VISA recommendation
- Talk Linux with Leon and Alfred

- Consolidate alien sprites
	O Work with Merks
	- Implement
	- Update installer/touch
- Invulnerability should show on view model (bug #303)
- Selection issues (waypoints not visible, very frustrating)
- Invisible webs
- Max web effect is too wimpy
- Resource model changes
	- Really think through this and work in excel on a new model
	O Random resources for aliens (pick a few random cards from hand, these are percentages from pool)
	X Remove trickle for marines (they can recycle)
	O No resources for kills, it's a closed system
	O Start with fixed resources don't add as they join
	O Pool resources for the hive (aliens have team resources AND individual resources)
	O When a player leaves the game, their points go back to pool (or half their points?  only in non-tournament mode)
	X When joining after the game starts, you always get fixed (minimum?) points
	O Remember points given to player while connected to server (to prevent joining/leaving repeatedly)
	O Increase hitpoints for all towers for bigger battles
	- Towers acquire resources, adding them to pool every so often.  This level is visible by looking at it.  When giving points to pool, the numbers are shown ("+10 resources") (for both marines and aliens)
	- If a player has full resources, the extra stay in the pool, to be redistributed to the rest of the team
	- The total resource pool (half of it?) is split among all players every 30 seconds or so
	O Portals should have lots more hitpoints (1000 to 2000)
	O Max alien resources now 50
	- Scoring: marine score is always the total score divided by # of players
	- What stops the aliens from rushing hard in the beginning?  If they die, they just come back, because the marines can't easily counter-rush.  The chance 
	of aliens taking out marine emplacements early is definitely worth it.  Cost the hive some points to respawn the player?  Then what happens if all the aliens
	rush, they can't respawn because there are no more points...the game just sits there with everyone dead?  Draw all alien hives to see if this fixes the problem 
	(it will also force the marines to attack, and let them move to intercept builders)
	O Allow hives to be hurt while spawning
		- TODO: Grow in hitpoints as it spawns (it's a buildable now, so refactor)
	- Add message for both sides when a tower has been depleted (kill the alien tower for them or show them where?)

O Display message when parasited
O The most recently dead would respawn before older dead (bug #200)
- Implement commander voting down
	O Remember players that have been voted down, don't let them become commander
	- Implement voting
		- When a vote is received, tell everyone on team that a vote has started
		- After x seconds, say that vote has ended and give results
O Allow aliens to build more then 3 upgrade buildings
O Reduced level 1 speed (just too fast for meaningful marine tactics)
O Added smooth energy transition
O Allow aliens to build any upgrade building to start
	- Need to propagate this to pop-up menu feedback
- Resource tower upgrades take longer, cost more, and speed resource acquistion less
O Alien turrets fixed! (bug #119)
O Cloaking is effective against turrets (turrets won't fire at a cloaked target)
O Alien turret projectiles are faster
O Level 5 redemption problems (bug #312)
O Reduced redemption probability slightly
O Turrets can be built before building is finished (bug #271)
O Fixed bug where ghost buildings sometimes showed when at an invalid build location
O Building and active hives are now always visible to marines
O Acid rocket and spike models shrunk
O Level 4 view model in!

O Gestation model no longer floats
	- TODO: lock it so it doesn't rotate
- Buildable command station bug (bug #308)
- Overlapping health/armor (bug #281)
- Commander console slips around (bug #263)
- Orient acid rocket and spikes properly

Difficulties that must be addressed

- DOD/Valve playtest
	- Maybe 5v5 DOD and Valvers, maybe 2 hours worth
	- No one understood aliens
	- Marines just ran off without building
	- Allow marines to get weapons themselves?
	- Show real path to get someplace
	- Show players how to upgrade to new lifeforms and new abilities (blinking to show new abilities have been added)
	- Show number of hives and hive status, including location (unborn, growing %, alive, under attack)
	- Tutorial is nice, but for this to really work, it has to be all in-game
	- Waypoints should have text showing what the waypoint means, and text to show where it is (just like alien hive sight)
	- Describe marines as "teamplayers" and aliens as "loners/regenades"
	
	* Show names of buildings, show built/unbuilt/progress/health : reticle shows you building name, health, status text, explanation, ability/function
	- Reticle over player shows you player name, type of marine/alien (level).  For same team, it shows you the weapon their holding, and their health as well.
	- Reticle over hive shows you name, status, health
	- Need an easy in-game (automatic) way to tell a player what an ability does (siege, bile bomb, umbra, etc.)

	O Show how many resources a tower is giving your team, ala WCIII/EE
	O Show damage feedback whenever you do damage to a building (to players too)
	O Show why you can't build something somewhere (when trying to evolve to an illegal lifeform, make error message closer to center or otherwise way more obvious)
	* Respawn timer 
	- Scoreboard

	- Label or distinguish subnodes for alien pop-up menu

O Increased effectiveness of webs again (back the way it was awhile ago)
- Stop blinking upgrade icon problem, make HUD look nicer
O Fix chat text blocking hints

O Reduced energy costs for all alien melee attacks so they can take out buildings without having to wait
O Reduced flier's flapping cost slightly, reduced fliers spike attack slightly

Post FOR LAN, Pre Tribes LAN
----------------------------
O Wall-running is now on by default, you can disable it by holding or tapping your crouch key
	- Jumping ramifications?
O Freeze players in place before game starts
O Fixed alien death animations
O Shaky ghost building bugs (when placing any buildings with any amount of lag)
O Fix That Damned Scoreboard!
	O Draw all effective player classes when observing
	O Get team headers right
		O All but "ready room when respawning"
	O Get colors right
	O Extra category for respawning players
	O Drawing respawning players slightly differently (noticeable for other team)
	O Don't order marines by score, do it alphabetically or by time in game (ent #?)
	O Fix bugs when switching teams and score doesn't revert
O Put back in feature where your old model is preserved after a game (your size is also preserved, let's hope there aren't people getting stuck in any ready rooms)
O Fix jetpack feel...Tribes players!
O Observatory cost lowered to 16 points (from 25)
O Scanner duration tripled
O Weapon bugs
	O Pistol can be fired quickly after drawing, so can knife
	O Button must be pressed repeatedly for knife, like other melee attacks
	O MG deploys faster
	O Fix bug were weapons can't fire immediately
O Removed invulnerability when spawning (by default, server can still enable it)
O Add particles back to phase in event (test)
O Level 3 flight maneuverability reduced some
O Phase gate cost halved, hitpoints doubled
O Building on resource towers (fixed bug where you could build resource towers on top of other towers)
O Command stations now are completely destroyed and can't be welded to be restored (have to figure out a better way to solve this, because welder journeys were great, but invisible command stations are unacceptable)
O Bile bomb damage reduced from 70 to 45, energy cost also reduced from .3 to .25 (they should be used for attrition and anti-building, less vs. players)
O Newly reskinned shotgun (thanks Beaner, SLAP, Def One!)
O New shotgun reloading behavior
	O Basics implemented
	- Still glitches with sounds and anims

O Spruced up textures for the infantry portal and phase gate, to make them look more Coryized (thanks a ton Merks!)
- Selection issues
	O Removed selection prediction.  Selection may feel slightly lagged, but it should work better.  Let me know if this is a good tradeoff.
	- Selecting a building, then build/advanced/equip causes menu to act strangely
- Fix phase gates
	O Effects play properly (particles, lines telescoping in, sound)
	- Spawning
- Players getting stuck in buildings bugs (reduced the chances of this a lot, but it can still happen)
- Make pop-up menu more accessible (do whatever it takes for mouse2)
- Finding hive locations
- Observing bugs
	- Attack and move right go to next target, attack2 and move left go to previous target

Post Tribes LAN
---------------
O Fixed grenade launcher sprite sometimes disappearing
O Add health indicator for buildings and players, differentiate from build indicator (so now it's easy to see when something isn't built) (thanks Relic!)
O Draw circle when reticle is on something (for commander, this is like mouseover in War III)
- TODO: Draw armor rating somehow
O Make welders functional for repairing buildings and armor
O Show when buildings aren't built yet, even when relatively far away from players
O Performance optimizations for calculating visibility and LOS (blips)
O Rings around buildings and players draw at better sizes, so they are more easily viewable
- Rework pop-up menu
	- Draw scaled, so same size at all resolutions
	- Ability to draw text and draw an image
	- Ability to grey out or disable areas
	- Draw normal instead of additively?
O Removed junky little blue selection circles, replaced with new health-circles 
O Fixed bug where victory sound would always play, now it plays the losing sound for players that lost
O Hud sounds shouldn't be cut off anymore (under attack, countdown, research complete, victory/loss, etc.)
O End game time is now 10 seconds (after victory is announced, this is how long the game keeps running until the map resets)
O Sound replacements (new songs for victory and loss, replaced countdown sound)
O Fixed bug where a marine resource tower and an alien resource tower can occupy the same node (bug #367)
O BIG balance change: all weapon damage reduced by 80%, to slow down combats and to have less player death in general (also reduced turret, siege and offensive chamber damage)
O Fixed command-station not resetting properly (bug #471)
O Removed "give" cheat (only works with cheats on)
- Add "Need attention" blinking icon for signalling commander

O New ns_tanith!
	-reduced file size, created ns_tanith.wad
	-fixed spawning in map instead of RR (duh, i left info_player_start in the map last time)
	-turned the map around 180 degrees so the marines start facing NORTH (makes a lot more sense)
	-enclosed outside satellite section with a forcefield (had to do this because aliens could build structures on the sky)
	-increased distance between MS and sat comm hive (makes laser strike more lucrative)
	-made cargo storage more defensible for the aliens
	-weldable vents only last 3 minutes instead of a permanent closure
	-removed some clip brushes (since aliens can build structures that 'sink' into clip brushes)
	-added a few more signs
	-added a tactical map of the level in the ready room (!)
	-removed placeholder music in the ready room (you can add your own mp3, rename any mp3 to 'tanith_rr.mp3' and place it in ns/sound/ns_tanith dir to listen)

O New damage types!
	- Normal damage -> Full damage against all targets
	- Piercing damage -> Full against players, half vs. buildings
	- Blast damage -> Full against buildings, half vs. players
	- Organic damage -> Does full damage vs. organic targets, does nothing against everything else (organic == players, babblers, hives, alien buildings)
	- A point of armor blocks two points of damage.  
	- Armor soaks 30% of incoming damage with no upgrades, then 50%, 70% and 90%
	- Power armor soaks 60% of incoming damage with no upgrades, then 70%, 80%, 90%

	Normal: Spit, knife, pistol, HMG, claws, welder, mines, swipe, bite2 (NS_DMG_NORMAL)
	Piercing: bite, spikes, LMG, shotgun, sentries, offensive chambers, leap (NS_DMG_PIERCING)
	Blast: Siege, grenades, xenocide, babbler blast, babbler bite, bile bomb, charging (NS_DMG_BLAST)
	Organic: Parasite, healing spray, spores, acid rocket (NS_DMG_ORGANIC)

O Bile bomb increased from 36 to 80 damage (but explosive now so it won't be killing players as much as it used to)
O Level 3 bite damage increased from 32 to 50
O Paralysis energy cost brought down from .2 to .13
O Tuned level 5 charge sound
O Increased damage of charge and increased energy cost as well (shorter, more meaningful charges)

RC6:
	O New pop-up menus!  (disables invalid options, is much clearer now (no longer graphical, but usability takes precedence over artistic desires in this case, and people are absolutely baffled by the old alien pop-up)
	O Fixed pop-up menu (!)  Works for any mouse button, and any key.  Also allows you to click a mouse button to choose an option.

	O HMG rounds increased to 150, max pistol ammo now 30
	O MG and pistol feel improved (thanks Gooseman!)
	O Moveable CC bug fixed
	O Release mode (should be a noticeable performance improvement on client and server, for everyone)
	O Map name (and author?) on scoreboard
	O Visible resources not resetting when switching roles (or on game reset)
	O No longer lose 1 point losing a building
	O Grens explode on impact with enemy team entities, bounce otherwise
	O Grenades, bile bombs, acid rockets and other weapons can generally hurt the launching player
	O New MG, sounds for anims as well
	O New prototype lab	model (goodbye HL grenade!) (this thing looks seriously amazing, thanks Squeal and Mojo!)
	O Fixed grenade model trying to play anim it doesn't have (printed error to console)
	O New shell (thanks Fam!)
	O Reduced flier armor from 100/125 to 60/100
	O Decreased def chambers from 6 points a second to 5

	O Fixed D3D problems for energy, resources and jetpack energy (draws to scale now, and works in D3D)
		- Jetpack energy still needs work
	O Make orders blinking
	O Draw orders (and help icons) scaled to world, so they are smaller when far away.  Decrease overall size of orders.
		- Draw text below it proportionally
	O New weapon sounds when reloading, deploying, etc..  Some of these obviously don't fit quite right yet or aren't synched up. (thanks Def One!)
	O New MG model ("I condensed it down to 3 256x256 maps, and then added some detail: graphically, the textures are more contrasted, the vid screen is closer in color to Cory's, and there are other various nick-nacks and refinements.  Polygonally, I've removed some pieces that bugged me, and used the extra space to add things like a proper bolt, and a casing around the clip port", "cleaned up a few polys (I went with the leaner look), polished up the maps, and here it is-- ready to swap") (thanks Bathroom!)
	O New player model for MG, new HMG view model (thanks Def One!)
	O New marine model animations! (thanks Def One!)
	O New animated alien buildings!  (thanks Mojo)
	O New death animations for the level 4! (thanks Mojo)

		- New lifts in general; no more of those 'U' shaped lifts.
		- Lightning is out, thunder is still in.
		- Lots of other little changes, eg join signs in readyroom are now the standard green signs, and the scrolling red line is on the floor instead of the ceiling now. (It's easier to see.)
	O New bast!
	O New caged!
		- "Fixed a ton of minor shaz that only I'd notice ... texture things, little bits of brushwork yada yada"
	O New ns_nothing!
		- "bug fixes such as the weldable behind the MS, sound goofs, condensed info_location names, etc."
	O New nancy!
		- "File size is waaaaay down.  I moved some resources nozzles and added 1 extra.  Each "start" has its own nozzel (1 by each hive, and the marine bridge has 1) and the rest are scattered evenly across the map so whoever controls most of the map, will control most of the nozzels.  I also took out the cantina wav from the start and took care of a few texture alignments."
	O Fixed intermittent client-crash that happened in large battles
	O Don't send help messages for weapons that are selected but disabled
	O Now players must wait 3 seconds getting in line to respawn, so death animation player properly

	* Reworked alien update message (got rid of old UI junk) in preparation for propagating hive info to alien players
	* Removed ancient has-jetpack can-respawn variables on client and server (stored in upgrade var)
	* Attempted to fix building sizes, but still doesn't work.  Keep values in there for when bug is fixed.
	* Added Steam-friendly versions of FindFirst/FindNext.  Not using them yet though, until NS works with current goldsrc.
	* New pop-up menu drawing!  Scales properly and easier to read (waiting for artwork now).

RC6a

	O Jetpack energy drawing tweaked

RC6b
	O Lowered alien respawn time from 20 seconds to 10 seconds

	O Fixed permaweb bug (whoops!)
	O Gorge spit energy cost reduced from .18 to .12, damage increased from 23 to 30
	O Players slow down when hit some (so players don't go flying away when bitten) (this is the old system, not the extreme system in CS)
	O Sensory chambers now detect enemies within range (they no longer do damage when touched though)
	O Offensive chambers shoot faster projectiles, hitpoints increased from 600 to 800
	O Hive spawn time reduced from 300 to 200 seconds

	O Don't generally play building animations when they interrupt another animation
	O Changed FOV to 90 for all aliens (used to be 110 for skulk, 100 for gorge, 80 for level 5).  This is necessary for software rendering support.  Let me know if you think it really detracts from the game or if you don't even notice.
	O New observatory model! (thanks Erex and Mojo!)
	O Added view offset when firing babblers, so they fire successfully more often when standing on the ground
	O Reduced siege upgrade time from 140 to 60 (seconds)
	O Reduced movement chamber build time from 50 to 30 (not seconds, unitless)
	O "Webbed" message now blinks
	O Extensive information about current number of hives, building status for hives, and upgrades linked to hives.  Enjoy.
	O Right-clicking will keep the pop-up menu open, until something is selected (makes it easier for players to stumble onto the menu instead of it disappearing too fast)
	O Fixed reticle help text color not always set properly (when using pop-up menu before changing weapons)
	O D3D (black edges) fixed
	O Armor and ammo level 1 upgrade time increased from 30 to 60

	O Observatory fixes (got rid of 48 polys that were doubled over on the back, also fixed all the uvws on the back so they used the correct part of the texture. deploy animtions also looks much cleaner.)
	O Base marine speed decreased 20%
	O All alien base speed increased slightly, speed upgrades lessened a bit (whoops, I overcompensated last time)
	O HMG damage reduced from 23 to 18
	O Rent
	O Pay bills
	O Send Jeff titles.txt (and techtree?)
	O Create base hud.txt and get Merks going on death messages
	O Phase gating through unbuilt gates
	O Secondary CC not able to be built
	O Removed tournament-mode rule where hives couldn't be respawned once they are destroyed

	O Lowered siege damage from 400 to 320
	O Build circle artwork tweaked to be more intuitive (color doesn't fade away at end of "trail")

	O Primary resource towers start fully built for both sides
	O Added death messages

	O Fixed problem where top-half of marine played wrong animation in ready room (now it plays walk/run for whole body when no holding a weapon)
	O All structures give one point to player, except resource towers which give 3 points (used to be that marine towers only gave one point, invalidating stats)
		- NOTE: points go to builder if he creates the structures, points go to the marine team if the commander gets them built (awarded when structure is fully built)
	O New tanith!
		-increased overall brightness 15%
		-changed big 'tanith' sign to a model
		-hive location names are now post-rc6b compatable
		-improved the tactical map in the readyroom
		-removed mp3 music from the readyroom
		-removed alien-only grates from the central tunnels
	O New bast!
		- Hopefully, this fixes 2 things: 1) people getting inadvertantly killed by the airlock, and 2) blocking the airlock with buildings.
		- The airlock still does damage for those who insist on really trying hard to stop the airlock with their bodies, but you'll see that it's a lot harder to do that now.  I put down a func_nobuild that extends a little outside the bounds of both sides of the airlock to prevent anyone from building close enough to it that the building would halt the airlock's rotation
	O New caged!
		- Minor visual stuff and a few ambient sounds
	O New nancy!
		1) Overhead grates in locker room removed.  Allows for some Bob ceiling climbing and the comander to drop items correctly in room.
		2) Vents redone near Marine Spawn and ones that stay mostly over hallways for more friendly commander interface
			2a) Part of the same lines, I'm particularly found of the new vent opening near the marine spawn from the ground. It looks quite yummy (you'll know it                 when you see it)
		3) Various little dents, dings various ambient brushwork to add to the overall setting.
		4) A few more texture fixes

	- Make minimap more functional for soldiers
		- Draw map correctly
		- Draw blips (teammates, enemies, buildings)
		- Draw names?
	- Aliens with jetpack effects from previous game
		O Temporarily removed jetpack effects
		- Rework...add smoke while in there?
	O Fixed bug where the welder stopped you from using your jetpacks (and probably had other very nasty side effects) (bug# 509)
	O Only allow resource towers on resource nodes (don't allow non-resource buildings to block access to nodes, pro-newbie, anti-llama)
	O Set first alien resource node as built when game starts (same for marines?)
	O Print out basic stats to log (victory team number, victory team type, map name, game length, game version)
		- Change time to minutes, seconds, include server name, IP?
	O Add blinking "paralyzed" message
	O Fixed problem where motion-tracking upgrade didn't show on marine HUD
	O When drawing armor, draw armor symbol using knowledge of current lifeform and max armor, not assuming 100
	O Fixed incorrect/loud ricochet sounds for lerk spike attack
	O Remove min range for siege
	X Change armory to give you ammo automatically when you're in range
		- Make sure it works properly when firing
		- Undone?
	O Ready room can't see voice
	O Slow down the player to a near standstill when using the HMG.  Also, the HMG can only be fired while on the ground.  Bumped damage from 17 to 19 to compensate.
	O Death animations now playing properly!
	O Slow down resources on both sides a little bit, to allow a little more momentum coherence in (esp. in beginning)?
		- Sanity check this with many bots before releasing
	O Capped pistol speed (6.66 shots per second)
	O Pistol damage changed from 25 to 20
	O Slowed down level5 charging so it doesn't look quite so comical
	O Hooked up gestation animations (looping gestate, flinching, death animation) (thanks Mojo!)
	O Write Lani about alien direction
	O Write Mark about soldier and commander direction
	O Respond to Ned about PR stuff
	O Tell Def One about ability slots for anims, also projectile for paralyze, ask for gore animation
	O Write Hugo about walk and idle for skulk, tell him about ability slots for anims
	X Write Hanz about doing spike hit sprite
	O Write Relic about special effects

	- Marine-crouching-suddenly bug for Mike

	O Check .wavs for Lani
		O Write Lani (send guidelines for alien voice, send any other samples for cc, discuss rate)
		O Write Max (send guidelines for soldier voice, discuss rate)

	O New particle effects (thanks Relic!)
		O Resource nozzles:  used different sprite and tweaked particle system values.  Not a huge difference, but it looks nicer to me.
		O Blink:  Uses new umbra sprite (see below) ie: looks like he appears in a cloud of sulfurous fume now
		O Spike hit!
		O Spores:  Modified the sprite to make it play smoother and look a little better.  Sporeclouds are a nice shade of alien green now.
		O Umbra:  Modified the sprite to make it play smoother and look a little better.
		O Weld stuff:  changed the sprites used for smoke, plasma, and droplets to create a more blue (and less obscuring) weld effect
		O Phasegate:  Changed the sprite used.  If it's too 'fairydust' for you, try using the "welddrip.spr" instead (don't forget to change the # of frames to 1).  As you know, I couldn't properly test this one because the particles refused to obey and went about on their own agenda.
		O Teleport/reinforcement spawn:  Tried a different approach.  You might want to double-check me on this, but is the flag value for "constrain pitch" on a particle system equal to 128?  I used this as an assumption, got a totally different result than I had intended, but liked the accidental result.  See what you think.  I also made a custom sprite for this.

	O Fixed bug where blink effect wasn't playing at both start and end of blink
	O Hives not taking damage before they're fully built
	O All turrets (sentries, siege, offensive chambers) now reacquire closest target periodically (ie, turret firing at hive will turn to fire at incoming enemies if closer).
	O Fixed lighting for skulk (tried using ceiling light level instead but that doesn't work most of the time)
	O Skulk bite damage reduced from 88 to 70.  Before you freak out, realize that it will still mean two bites to kill 85% of all marines!  This just means heavy marines don't die in .5 seconds vs. skulks (it also means one skulk can't rip through an entire base of buildings).
	O Play spike ricochet sounds less often and quieter (> 16 sounds with spikes esp.)
	O Play less shotgun ricochet sounds
	O Removed marine and alien points-received sounds (old placeholders, didn't need to be replaced)
	O Distress beacon cost lowered from 30 to 15
	O Phase gates no longer require prototype labs, just the observatory, cost for gates raised from 15 to 25
	O New soldier model, with aiming and firing animations!  New p_models for weapons!  Touched up view models for skulk, onos and hmg! (thanks DefOne!)
	O New heavy model and new level 5 model!  (thanks DrHugo!)

	O Marine equipment spawning issues
		O Never remove equipment dropped by commander
		O Anything dropped by a player lasts for 30 seconds (set by server as mp_weaponstaytime, in minutes)
	X Wall climbing orientation
		O Started work on it, wrote Brian
		O Use his response to make this work
		O Changes undone
	O In ready room, use regular walk/run animations (not walk_noweaponname) so upper body looks right
	O Draw range of observatory and sensory chambers when selected by commander
	O Observatory and sensory chamber ranges now act in 2D (like siege), so commander can see what regions are affected
	O Stop giving points for building on alien side (or give them for marines too)
	O Revisit onos view model to make sure Def's new changes work properly
	O Healing spray no longer sprays through walls or buildings, you need line of sight

	O Spore damage reduced from 36 to 30
	O Alien resource tower health lowered from 2000 to 1000
	O Updated nancy (moved resource node in hive so it allows hive building)
	O Big resource model change as an experiment:
		O Resource towers are essentially infinite, but give resources much more slowly (2000 points each, giving out one point every six seconds instead of 360 points, 2 points every 5 seconds).
		O Kill Grendel if you hate this model.  That is all.
	O Commander idle sounds play less frequently
	O New acid rocket effect, new bacterial spray effect (thanks Relic!)
	O Command station health increased from 3500 to 9000
	O All new final soldier sounds!
	O All new final commander sounds!

	O Take into account gamma when drawing things in HUD color (fonts should be the right color now)
	O Draw blips while gestating
	O Don't draw various UI elements during time between dying and getting in line to respawn (armor, hive info, resources, tooltips, etc.)
	O Draw health for building or entity you're looking at, no matter the distance (instead of scanning immediate area for buildings).  Possible noticeable client performance improvement here.
	O Gorges get to see health for teammates
	O Server optimization: turrets search for new enemies less frequently (from 10 times a second to once every .8 seconds)

	O Added new console backdrop (thanks Squeal!)
	O Aliens with no hives have a max of 33 resources, not 0
	O In an effort to shorten games and have less random node grabbing, resource nodes are now destroyable.  If a tower is successfully built on a node and then destroyed, the node can no longer give resources to either side for the rest of the game.  A node that's been destroyed in this manner will no longer allow towers to be built on them.
	O Resource towers take longer to build, cost more, and are harder to destroy.  This may be the right solution for the rampant resource trading we've been seeing.

	O Put in tooltip that explains the object of the game
	O Higher HP for siege (1000 to 2000)

	O Fixed bug where using alien abilities sometimes played the "illegal action" sound
	O Addressed exploits where alien abilities could be bound to keys (player is immediately killed)

	- Remaining Max tasks
		O Emailed him with "There's something you don't see every day", "Why am I so good" and pain, death sounds

	- Performance issues
		- Turrets
		- General performance
			- Regular bots should think like regular players for easily profiling
			- VTune pointed out AvHDetermineVisibility and some of the casting in there, but not sure if I believe it
			- Performance with many bots seemed identical to that of many players, then I rebooted and now game performance with even 25 bots is minimal (?)

RCX - final

	O Reduce motion-tracking research time from 180 to 100
	O Reduced portal build time from 30 to 22
	O Reduced shotgun damage from 18 to 16
	O Increased siege range from 1100 to 1250
	O Increased HMG damage from 19 to 20 (double the power for regular MG)
	O Fixed armory texture (not sure what was wrong though)
	O New bast with particle performance fixes
	O Added door sounds back in again
	O New optimizations
	? Allow players to change name after game started, as long as they haven't left the ready room
	? Fixed gamma correction for auth icons

	? Slow down particle propagation to fix timeouts?
	? Bast particle performance

	O Scan effect not visible in current build (missing/bad ParticleEvent.sc, scan.spr or particle name in ns.ps)
	O Zero velocity of players going through phase (reduces chance of falling into hole after going through)
	O Missing door sounds
	O Replaced pistol sound with beefier one
	? Respawn with full energy instead of 0 energy
	? Added alert for sensory chambers ("The enemy approaches")
	? Added alert for builders.  Now it only plays every 30 seconds and won't play if you have builders or players that are evolving to builders, or not enough alive players.
	O Fixed bug where scanning also issues an order
	O Look into network messages being sent on an endgame (redundant messages or something is causing overflows still)
	O Updated spectator mode with new text and new camera distance for more cinematic feel
	O Updated auth icons (thanks Relic!)
	O Resized lerk
	O MG, pistol and HMG muzzle-flashes now emit from the correct locations, new muzle flash sprites
	O Update marine hud sprite
		O Info_Location
		O New mainhud.spr from Relic
	O Limit # of buildings in an area (do generically)
	O Change upgraded weapon sounds
		O Emailed Scott H about making new ones

	O Fixed client-side crash on changelevel and removed all "no such sprite" errors
		O Has to do with particles drawing on map change, possibly with invalid sprites?  Possibly lag-related, test with fakelag?
	? Write Relic about last particle effects
		- Turret smoke
	? Add new jetpack effects
	O Welder performance
	O New blink effect (better performance)
	O Doubled grenade launcher rate of fire (improves feel and spam isn't an issue now)
	O Skins are now working properly after a map change or reset
	O Removed placeholder Q3 texture (nos_wall3) from ns_bast.wad
	? Aliens not playing their death anims sometimes?
		O DIE_BACKWARD not working for skulk or gorge.  Posted list of art fixes to forum.
	? Add particle effect for commander hacking (not working properly yet)
	O New alien sounds for "structure under attack", "resource tower under attack" and "lifeforms under attack" (a bit calmer, less grating)
	O New and final hera
		- All ladders should now be walkable on by skulks.
		- New weldable into the back entrance to Data Core Delta, accessable from the seizure corridor. (Tell me if there's any speed problems there, although there shouldn't be.)
		- New path from Maintenance to Processing. (Extention of the small corridor.) Level5s can only crawl through these corridors, mind.
		- Archiving Hive now has a 2nd entrance on floor level, accessable with a welder.
		- Marine Start Warehouse door can now be opened from the marine side, but only once the panel on the other side has been welded.
		- Floor panels in the Holoroom are now solid.
		- Marine Command Centre now very much protected, as you'll see. Commander can also build up there, although most of the floor is still invisible so he can see the area below.
		- Replaced all momentary_doors with normal doors because I'm suspicious that they might not be working satisfactorily.  (I would recieve "found momentary_door 'labdoor03', firing." style messages constantly, for all the different doors.)
		- Not sure if this is new or not, but the Data Core Delta resource node has been moved much nearer.
		- Security Door welds have been cosmetically changed to fit in with the rest of the welds in the map.
		- New door textures for marine start. Woo!
		- Various tweaks here and there, as usual.

	- Easter eggs
		O "Now, we donce"

		- "Not bad for a human"

	O Fix skin color changing every time you spawn
	O Fixed bug where muzzle flash played even when firing on empty

	? Move help text to client (CPU and network performance)
	O Make player ID visible in ready room and spectator mode
	O New eclipse
		- Made a couple texture switches in accordance with the modified ns.wad
		- -wadincluded ns_eclipse.wad (so don't include that file anymore)
		- fixed a func_illusionary railing
		- and made the doors to marine spawn reset quicker.

	O Fixed marines health circle when dead (used to draw fully sometimes)
	O Recycled IP doesn't reset reinforcing player
	O Change self-damage to 50%
	O Removed builder scoring.  Score should be kills only (though commanders have a score equal to their average team score, rounded up).  Sorry MonsE, your reign of terror is over.  Builders now get points for their own turret kills.
	O Spawning issues
		O Make sure players spawn at random hive spot, so they can't be camped easiily, and also make sure the area isn't blocked by something
		O Infantry portal and phase gate now kills any players too close to the respawning player
	O Fixed blink effect playing multiple times
	X Bug/exploit when joining team and hitting F4 at the same time
		- Can't repro
	O Dead aliens don't receive hive sight updates, maybe this will fix occasional alien/death overflow
	O Fixed possible cause of last alien client crash

	O Fixed acid rocket and bilebomb projectile orientation

	? Possibly fixed progress indicators sometimes not visible
	O Tweaked selection to make it easier/possible to select buildings when close together
	O Fix shotgun weirdness when reloading and firing
		O Playing idle animation in middle of reload causing hitch (it's doing this because the reload is happening server side, so mSpecialReload isn't set on the client)
		O Faster reload
		O Fixed bug where it refilled instantly sometimes
	O Team resources label not visible when joining team
	O Voting messages should now be sent properly
	O New health/armor HUD sprites for low resolution, removed "CS" from an ammo sprite
	O Revisit HUD in general, and layout everything properly (put all constants in one file)
		O Move current commander text to left slightly
		O Move commander text and resource labels up slightly
		O Adjusted info location for low-res
		O Move chat so it doesn't block resource text as alien
		O Alien reticle help blocking "resources"
		O Armor and health icons overlapping
		O Move marine tooltip help to left, past these upgrades
		O Only draw one damage and one armor upgrade, one jetpack/heavy upgrade, and align towards bottom (prevents collision with voice)
		- Decrease font size for lower resolutions (#489)
		- Test in all resolutions
			Less then 640 - Tooltip font way too big, info location text isn't positioned properly, hive info icons and text crappy, weapon icons show snarks, crosshairs aren't the same, commander text and team resource text too low, icons for health and armor aren't updated

RCX patch - Final gold
----------------------
O Fix for various marine HUD elements not showing up (team resources, etc.)
O Doom, TommyD auth icons
O Mines using p-model or something when held
O Missing muzzle flash sprites
O New version of caged with some wad changes and fixes for some messed up clipnodes near the sewer hive
O If you join the readyroom while dead (f4) you spawn into the map, yet as a readyroom type player is still in.  I did it in hera, tonight.  You need to rejoin the server, to get to the RR again.
O Binding for jetpack, not nuke
O Remove disconcerting "unable to open commandmenu.txt" message
O Find and fix telefragging issues
O Added "auth" confirmation (ON/OFF message)
? Gamma doesn't reset when quitting at console
	- Only happens with VAC.  Wrote e-mail to ES and EJ, awaiting response
O Added auth mask confirmation messages
- Overflow with 22 players or so and a fair number of buildings (10 marines, 12 aliens I think)
	- Only happens with real players, not bots
	- Interesting fix: only propagate entities with non-team of 0 for players that aren't in the ready room?

Make sure icons are right
Created 3 shortcuts on my desktop that went away on their own after 2 mins
Default music level should 200, should be 90

O Fixed jetpacks and HA being able to be picked up by aliens
O Increased Onos claw range so he can hit targets without crouching
O Info locations aren't clearing/resetting properly always
O See if I can get gamma resetting without atexit()
O Removed donating text from friendly hive description
O Fixed liblist.gam size
O Umbra disappearing after a few seconds (I think this is the cull time!)

NS v1.01
--------
	O Moved all gameplay constants into server code, so economy and balance will be identical on all servers
	O Added auto team-balance: you are not allowed to join a team if joining it would give that team more then 2 players more then the other team.
	O Increased server performance by 20-30% (should result in slightly less lag, more changes coming here)
	O Dropped health and ammo packs now expire after 30 seconds
	O Sentry cost increased from 16 to 19
	O Sentries and siege turrets now need a functioning factory to stay operational.  They will power down and become inactive there are no factories nearby.  If a new factory is built nearby, they will power back up.
	O Offensive chamber health increased from 1100 to 1200
	O Lessened siege damage from 350 to 330
	O Acid rocket rate of fire increased from .66 to 1.0 (shots per second)
	O Increased fade armor from to 90/125 to 125/150
	O Increased acid rocket damage from 50 to 60
	O Increased base speed of fade from 210 to 240
	O Changed regeneration upgrade from fixed number to percentage of alien max health.  Alien also emits regen sound when healing.
	O Grenade damage reduced from 200 to 180 (still does blast damage), clip size reduced to 4, rate of fire decreased slightly
	O Increased research time for heavy armor from 80 to 100
	O Increased HMG cost from 23 to 25
	O Increased grenade launcher cost from 27 to 33
	O Increased cost of heavy armor from 20 to 25
	O Lower cost for offensive chambers from 16 to 14, and build time from 40 to 30
	O Friendly fire now does 33% damage instead of full damage (tournament mode only)
	O Lessened HMG damage from 20 to 18
	O Numeric indicator at resource towers now shows how many actual resources were contributed to your team (minimum 1)

NS v1.02
--------
	O Fixed bug where parasite could hurt own team
	O Fixed bug which allowed players to damage their own structures with gunfire
	O Updated code to be more compatible with Adminmod under win32 (dynamic cast issues).  It may still not work under some configurations and work continues on it.
	O Enhanced hive sight changed so it's useful at upgrade levels 1 and 2
	O Updated NS to use the HL standard logging specification for server ops and for PsychoStats compatibility (http://www.hlstats.org/logs).  More work may be needed for better Psychostats compatibility.
	O Removed draw numeric damage events
	O Sighted buildings no longer show in hive sight (still show up with parasite, but prevents flood when alien views heavily populated area)
	O Fixed exploit where +using a building could speed up research of a technology
	O Preserve health and armor percentages when evolving
	O Don't allow gorge to heal buildings before they are built
	O Reduced chance of server overflow (crash) when large games (24+ players) end
	O Fixed marine armor upgrades (previously, researching armor upgrades wouldn't give you that armor unless you were welded first)
	O Added mp_logdetail (0-3)
	O Changed the alien ability anti-exploit code to try to co-exist with scripters
	O Turned off team-balance when in tourny mode
	O Renamed ns_authicons to mp_authicons, renamed ns_eastereggchance to mp_eastereggchance for consistency
	O Defensive chambers now only heal up to three nearby buildings or players per tick (prevents undestructible Walls of Lame).  Targets are chosen randomly.
	O Cleanup babblers on game reset
	O Built with compiler optimizations (linux)
	O Spectators now hear spectators, their observer target and teammates of their observer target
	O Networking changes that could result in CPU performance improvements (instead of tracking, storing and queuing network messages, they are sent immediately)
	O All players can all hear all other players talking before countdown starts
	O Tournament mode start changes to make it easier to coordinate and start a game.  It will only start when players are on both teams, when the teams are equal, and when both teams have said they are ready. A team is ready when one member of their team says "team x ready" (case not important, x is 1 or 2).
	O Spectators get end-game victory sound and message

Please make sure to put "1.02" somewhere in your server name so players know if you've updated.  The patch is 1.8 megabytes and contains both the linux and win32 versions.<br>

	dlls/ns_i386.so
	listenserver.cfg
	server.cfg
	skill.cfg (needed to include v1.01)
	dedvars.cfg (needed to include v1.01)

Performance:
------------
	O Revert to old AddToFullPack, but use new caching
		O Didn't work (but performance was still good)
	O Update SetupVisibility to cache at same rate as AddToFullPack
	X Check client to make sure it has the same data as server
	- Try removing network buffering as next/final big optimization

NS v1.03
--------
	O Fix mail/Netflix problem
	O Visit Zach, Iron Lore with Chris and Chad
	O Groceries
	O Bills (Friday)
	O Laundry (Friday)
	O Pack summer clothes, unpack winter clothes
	O Cancel Bounceweb crap (Friday)
	O Jump car (Friday)
	O Stamps (Saturday)
	O Figure out what to repair on car (Weekend)
	O Fixed Adminmod compatibility problems.  It should work great now under all configurations.  Let me know if you're still having crashes.
	O Added mp_version variable for better filtering with All-Seeing Eye and other third-party programs and scripts.
	O Changed siege cost from 15 to 25 (this was a typo, not meant to be a balance change).
	O Changed team join to not allow teams to have more then 1 player difference. Affects casual model only.
	O Fixed readyroom bug/exploit while spectating (hitting F4 while REIN made you an invulnerable "ghost" player that could confuse others).
	O Added support for model and sound consistency checking.  If you run your server with mp_consistency 1 (the default), it will require that all NS models and sounds are unchanged from the distribution.  This allows servers to disable custom models or sounds, and exploits that can result from them.
	O Fixed infinite cloaking bug (occured when last sensory chamber lost while player was cloaked).
	O Addressed alien leave/join resource exploit (joining a team you've already been on makes the player wait to respawn, as if he had been killed).
	O Addressed early team-switch exploit to find hive (you can no longer switch teams after playing or observing).
	O Aliens now lose health when all their hives are gone (damages every 2 seconds, all players hear countdown, ignores armor).  This is done to speed up the end game and prevent llamas from hiding in vents to prolong game.  If at least one hive is growing, players won't be damaged.
	O Fixed various problems when building turrets, mines, offensive chambers, etc. then team-switching.
	O Fixed explosion bug!  Siege, bilebombs, grenades and xenocide weren't doing damage properly.  Now they do.  Goodbye, farms of all kinds.
	O Moved mp_drawinvisibleentities to debug builds only.
	O Fixed mp_timelimit problems (I think, please test)
	O Fixed Onos charging crash bug (I think, please test by playing with lots of Oni)
	O Reduced knife range from 50 to 35 (not balance, this was a bug).
	O Fixed melee weapon problems in vents (I think, please test)
	O Fixed lastinv command.  Players can now bind a key to this (even though their menu will say it's not implemented).
	O Fixed bug where players did friendly fire damage to some world objects (ie, doing 33% instead of 100% to doors and switches).
	O Fixed turret factory abuse, where turrets became active after recycling the nearby turret factory before turret was fully contructed.
	O Fixed bug where siege turrets became re-activated after building a regular turret factory nearby.
	O Default mp_timelimit is now 60 (even for listen server).
	O A team now automatically wins if they have 5 or more players then another team (generally because the losing team starts quitting).  Affects casual mode only.
	O Fixed bug where a vote could affect a commander that logged in after a vote had been started.	
	O Fixed armor bug where carapace protected aliens even after all armor was gone
	O Fixed bug where gorges evolving upgrades (usually temporarily) lost resources above the hive maximum.  It will still count down to 33, but will immediately count back up to your resource count (this is just a visual problem on the client).
	O Fixed timelimit bug (broken in 1.03b)
	O Make sure current health and armor percentages are preserved when evolving
	O When the alien team no longer has any growing or active hives, all aliens slowly take damage. This is done to speed up the end game and prevent hiding llamas.
	O Include shells.mdl (should fix consistency errors that were preventing players from joining server)

	- Adminmod and SQL patch

	- Commander PAS issues
	- Webstrand/vision-mode bug
	- Aliens being stuck in structures
	- Marines being stuck in structures

	- Entities not being cleaned up totally on a map reset?
	- Evolve to skulk while stuck under lift on nothing causes server crash (?)
	- Server op command to kick the commander?
	- Marine building limit like aliens

	- Game start problems (with no players or 1 player)
	- Remove mp_networkrate variable?
	- Logging issues
		- ** Psychostats fixes, everything he mentioned **
		- There exists a logging bug, where all kills are being logged twice.
		L 11/17/2002 - 15:14:04: "[DSSGR]Bubbabooye<548><2398808><marine1team>" 
		killed "El Beeno<546><2852477><alien1team>" with "heavymachinegun"
		L 11/17/2002 - 15:14:04: "[DSSGR]Bubbabooye<548><2398808><marine1team>" 
		killed "El Beeno<546><2852477><alien1team>" with "heavymachinegun"
		Its for every kill from what I can tell.  

		- Also, its not logging player ID's properly.  As you can see the player ID is 548 where as my server can only handle up to a max of 24 playerid's at this point, so there is a secondary bug which is elevating the playerId's instead of rolling over and taking empty slots.

v1.04
-----
	O Fixed "stopcommandermode" exploit (allowed aliens to look like marines and fire marine weaponry)
	O Changed max machine gun ammo to 250 (used to be 300, though it would only display 250)
	O Fixed commander weapon exploit (using inventory commands).  Weapon commands in general (drop, switch, last) won't work for commanders.  This can no longer be exploited by building near the command station as well.
	O 3rd party entities are never propagated to client (ie, adminmod_ entities).  This could fix an occasional crash (thanks Alfred)
	O Moved auto-concession on unfair teams into server variable (mp_autoconcede: if set to greater then 0, then if teams are ever different by this many players, that smaller team loses immediately)
	O Dead players can now talk to their teammates in both casual and tourny mode (needed to prevent team from getting an advantage by using external voice program in CAL)
	O Fixed problem where ammo could be picked up while holding mines
	O Aliens without any hives no longer take damage when the server is in tournament mode
	O Add more triggers (for Psychostats and 3rd party program support)
		O Added "player built x" (for commander and aliens)
		O Added "recycled x"
		O Added "started research x"
		O Added "cancelled research x"
		O Update to use StormTrooper's recent notes
	O Fixed visual problem where advanced armory had weird build circle
	O Reduced radius of acid rocket splash from 200 to 165
	O Alien respawn time reduced from 10 to 8
	O Reduced shotgun cost from 20 to 16
	O Reduced welder damage from 10 to 7
	O Armory can now give out ammo while upgrading to advanced armory
	O Increased cost of infantry portal from 15 to 22
	O Increased cost of phase gate from 20 to 25
	O Decreased health of phase gate from 3500 to 2000
	O Increased scan cost from 1 to 3
	O Umbra now blocks 3 out of 4 bullets instead of 6 out of 7 (86% -> 75%)
	O Arms lab reduced from 50 to 45 points
	O Reduced siege cannon range from 1250 to 1100 
		NOTES:
			- The green circle that appears when the siege cannon is selected by the commander is using the old range, but this will be fixed in v1.1.
			- This is the value siege range was for most of our internal playtesting (hence the bast and hera issues that suddenly arrived with v1.0)
	O Siege cannon targets now must be sighted to be hit (in view of friendly player or scanned by commander)
	O Hives now spawn with full health instead of having to heal up to full health on spawn
	? Fix bug where advanced turret factories don't have full health
	? Acid rocket showing damage icon when not taking damage?  Range working right?
	O The advanced armory now has 2400 health instead of 1500 (same as regular armory, this is a fixed bug, not a balance change)
	O Fixed bug where tournament mode caused some damage to be reduced more then it should be (acid rocket vs. any alien structures)
	O Fixed bug where hive would sometimes play wound sound/animation when it got hit but didn't take damage
	O Removed lingering "organic" damage type for acid rocket and spore cloud (fixes bug where acid rocket wasn't doing damage properly to organic structures)
	O Aliens donate only half their points back to their team resource pool when they leave the team (less exploitable, but this will be revisited in v1.1)
	O Fixed non-visible motion sensor and proximity "blips" (linux only)
	O Defense chambers no longer heal themselves
	O Removed gibbing of corpses (off by default, but some servers had enabled it).  This means death animations always play, so no more disappearing models when using high-powered weapons.
	O Alien health circles seen by gorge now take armor into account (so gorge knows when player is fully healed)
	O Morphing resets your health again (preserves percentage of armor when evolving carapace too)
	O Fixed logging bug where model name was reported instead of team name for say and and say_team
	O Fixed problem where aliens could gain resources by joining and leaving the team repeatedly (also caused problems by "carrying over" resources from one game to the next).  Now if an alien leaves the team, half his points go back into the pool, and half are lost.  This is a compromise and may need to be revisited.
	O When hive is constructed, have it check to see if technology should be supported automatically (exploit for getting extra upgrades after a hive is killed and rebuilt)
	O Observers can hear other observers and players on the screen, and can chat with each other
	O Fixed various problems with holding mines while building or using command station
	O Changed cloaking so it deactivates when a player moves faster then a certain speed, fixing an exploit.  Moving very slowly should allow an alien to remain cloaked.
	O Added "highdamage" cheat for testing (sv_cheats must be 1, all damage is x100 vs. buildings, x10 vs. players)
	O Added "slowresearch" cheat for testing (sv_cheats must be 1, research takes full time instead of normal 2 seconds when cheats are on)
	O Phase gates now must be +used instead of just touched (less frustrating when trying to attack them or fight nearby)
	O Don't play "select your troops, and give them orders" commander hint if you have no other players on your team
	O Grenades and mines are now affected by arms lab damage upgrades (this will make grenades and mines more powerful when upgraded, but the damage values of these weapons haven't been touched)
	O Fixed exploit where multiple upgrades from the same category could be purchased by jamming hotkeys (thanks localhost!)
	O Fixed bug where trying to exploit alien abilities could crash the server
	O Fixed bug where server name wasn't displayed on scoreboard
	O Reduced "intermission" time after game ends before mp_timelimit is checked.  Disabled mp_timelimit map-switching for tournament mode.

	O Put in 2 second wait time for phase gates so you aren't phased immediately (also changed similar functionality for movement chamber to 2 seconds instead of 3)
	O Phase gates now only play their effects (particles, sound, light) when there another active phase gate (so a player can look at a phase gate and know if he can go through it)
	? Fixed end-game server crash for large games
	O Fixed rounding errors for level 3 arms lab upgrades for marine weaponry (thanks Kitsune and Comprox!)
	O Fixed bug where babbler and xenocide damage wasn't being applied properly (babbler damage was halved, xenocide wasn't doing blast damage)
	O Fixed bug where laser-style mines sometimes wouldn't go off when touching the base
	X Re-enabled siege minimum range (10% of range, )
	O Turret factory cost reduced from 25 to 20
	O Siege turret cost reduced from 25 to 20
	O Lerk spike damage increased from 16 to 18 (big lerk changes coming in v1.1, this is a hold-over)
	? Fixed problem where dead players can sometimes hear spectator or enemy team voice comm
	O Fixed problem where mines sometimes blow up on their own for no apparent reason after they are placed
		- Introduced new problem where they don't blow up when their are on entities that start to move
		- Mines shouldn't blow each other up or hurt their own team in any way
	O Added "detectall" cheat for testing motion-tracking and marine blips
	O All entities can hurt themselves (allows 1-hive alien team to battle siege)
	O Allow siege turrets to see targets themselves (no spotter needed if in sight of the turret)

	O Fix problem where killing a phase gate doesn't turn off it's ambient sound
	O Tweaked armories to refill your primary ammo supply before your clip
	O Stats changes for Stormtrooper - Changed role change
	X Stats changes for Stormtrooper - Add research_end or research_finished
	O Stats changes for Stormtrooper - Added structure_destroyed
	O Stats changes for Stormtrooper - Added structure_built for hives
	O Send Stormtrooper log of with full technology on both sides
	O Fade cost increased from 44 to 54
	O Movement chambers now teleport to aliens to a hive that's under attack, or the farthest active hive if none are under attack.
	O Carapace now slowly gives out extra armor points with upgrade level, instead of giving it out all at once.  For example, a skulk with 0/1/2/3 carapaces has armor of 10/16/22/30.  All other properties of carapace remain the same.
	O Regeneration upgrade now heals approximately twice as fast
	O Redemption increased in effectiveness slightly
	O Hive now heals nearby players faster in effort to allow aliens better chance to hold off early marine rush (20 points per second instead of 8)
	O Added ability for guides to send hint tooltips to individual players
	O Cloaking changed so higher levels make it faster to cloak.  All levels now make the alien equally invisible (not quite invisible, but very close)
	O 2nd hive building bug (problem with -O2)
	- Fix problem where you can't see enemies as commander under linux (again)
	- The siege guns sometimes just decide NOT TO FIRE when they're in complete line of sight
	- Introduce variable hive respawn time for larger team sizes
	O A webbed marine can hop in the CC, and his gun will come come up, allowing him to shoot
	X A marine who is building, can hop in the CC before his gun is up, and shoot
	O Grenades not hurting the firer, grenade damage sounds low
	- Pistol rate of fire (script abuse)

	- Siege idle/targetting issues (http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=1&t=19635&s=1676545791a8627fbb9a9937692e7de6)
	O Increased delay on phase gates so a player can only use one every 2 seconds (reduces chance of telefrag exploit)
	O Test alien impulses (make sure they don't crash server)
	O Fixed bug where hive death animation kept looping after hive was dead
	O 1 bullet to kill hive bug (win)
	O Fixed all problems with motion-tracking and visibility under linux
		O Search code for other problems with this (AddToFullPack has some but there are no problems there yet)
		? Make sure hives have 0 velocity
	O Fixed bug where offensive chambers hurt themselves when firing in tourny mode
	O Fixed turret factory upgrade problem (where factory had to be +used after upgrade before siege could be built)
	O Tweaked animation for upgraded turret factory and armory
	O Reverted armory resupply change due to reloading weirdness (and it didn't really fix the problem)
	X Reset crash under linux with Adminmod
	O Players are allowed to join teams freely in tournament mode
	- Add r_drawviewmodel enforcing

	O Write Jay Patel
	O Feedback on Jeff's resume
		- Write to GDP mailing list
	- Decide on NCsoft interview
	- Write arena.net again
	- Call Ned 9pm EST

	- Consider adding ability for aliens to donate to other aliens or to the hive (and doing so marks them as not getting resources for a minute or so?)
	- Give all aliens 33 resources to start?

	- Send quote to Lani
	- Fix bug where countdown sound was heard from readyroom after a game ended
	- Permacloak exploit:
		Bind a button to +strafe (say it was alt)
		Get cloak and wait for 3 sensory chambers
		Stand still until you cloak
		Hold the bound button and move around with your mouse
	? Intermittent server crash with 20+ players on end-game (reset half players, wait, then the other half)
	O Maps not changing anymore?  Linux only?
	X Glitch where linux build said v1.03 instead of v1.04
	- Dual logging bug?

	- Using readyroom bug to run around as godmode player and harass people and block doorways
	- Limit mines (200+ causes server to crash?  Just too many entities?)
	X Mines can now be blown up if they take enough damage
	X Mines blowing up after they become armed (I think they're touching a world entity?)
	- Increase lerk spike damage and decide on role vs. buildings (maybe it should do blast damage?)
	X If you upgrade a turret factory & it gets destroyed then you cannot upgrade any other turret factories for the rest of the game.
		- Adv. turret factory bug?
			<Grendel> JarHedz is working perfectly except for this:
			<Grendel> After upgrading Turret Fac to Advanced TFac, you then need to rebuild it.
			<Grendel> Was a bug in about RC4 or 5.
	- Remove building stacking for both sides
	- Fix getting stuck in alien resource towers
	- Rework welds
		- Resetting
		- Taking damage
		- Parasite and spit killing them? (bast weld near airlock)
	X Chat text flooding to crash server (couldn't repro)

	Linux stuff
	O Update linux code to use GCC (talk to Joev)
	- Test tournament mode and no-hive countdown under linux (forgot to check it in I think)
	O Blips under Linux don't work (motion-tracking and commander mode blips, also commander mode aliens)
	O Make sure motion-tracking is still working and working properly (linux)
	- Server crash from Josh Beeler (11/27 core dump) (linux)

NS v1.1
-------
	Balance, playability, depth
	- Address issues in Eats' write-up
	- Make lerk nastier with one hive (spike damage, lessen flight energy?) or change him to support only
	- Tighten HMG cone to make better vs. ranged fades/oni and harder to respond to skulk chomping on leg
	- Possible energy change: allow energy to come back much faster (2x?) when standing still (to reduce annoying chomp-on-stationary-thing syndrome, to speed up fades/lerks vs. buildings)
	- Reduce initial marine points by making them scale? (makes early game aliens more equal)
	- Address problem where more gorges == slower growth (non-intuitive): More gorges should increase alien growth speed (increases value of scouting and probing heavily, means less waiting and problems for newbie aliens, gives more interesting configurations and builds for aliens)
		- This may very well allow the removal of the 33/66/100 limit for each hive too!
		- Experiment with larger starting resources for aliens and slightly slower growth, so they have more options to start and less overall waiting
		- Make changes to allow earlier hives but with less resources coming in (right now it's not really viable...perhaps making 1-hive lerk viable will change this)
		- Allow resources to run out (need some kind of alert for gorges at least though)
		- Starting resources problem where it doesn't scale properly for all games (100 vs. 10 per player)
	- Make resources run out (balances multiple gorges, means marines can't play the turret and wait game) (add "resources running low" alert for both sides)
	- Consider adding a "phase gate tech" upgrade on observatory that's required for phase gates
	- Consider changing scanner sweeps to only be used every so often (would promote building multiples as well)
	- Change map guidelines and tell mappers not to place hives/CC such that they can be attacked from outside the room or from an easily defended remote location (ns_nothing)
	- Aliens hitting F4 or reconnecting to return resources to team (still present, or resolved with balance changes?)
	- Remove nuke binding in config
	- Change OCs to shoot spikes instead of spit
	O Add new graphic effect for when alien structures are killed
	- Make multiple observatories viable
	- Increase range on observatory so they can be forward built when sensory chamber is detected (may have to decrease cost for it though, and add the phase gate research instead)
	- Make multiple armories viable (only two people can re-arm at a time or too annoying?)
	- Check/draw scanner range to make sure it feels right
	O Tweaked alien field of view for immersiveness (skulk and gorge can see slightly more, onos can see slightly less).  This was in the game for a long time, but was removed when attempting to support software.
	- Make orders expire properly
	? <EdL|plex> you should knock out ex_ commands in the next release
	- Little green bars on weapon HUD icons don't show max ammo right for MG (probably others too)
	- Draw weapon pickup icons for marines
	- Alien upgrade adjustments to make non-defense viable in early game
		- Replace Scent of Fear with "Danger sense".  Any enemy players within range of a player show up on hive sight (as if they were parasited).  Each level increases range.
		- Movement chambers move you to random hive under attack.  If none are under attack, it moves you to farthest hive or hive site (including unbuilt hives).  If you are near a hive that's under attack when using it, it won't teleport you there?
		- Make all alien structures slowly regenerate so def chambers aren't used everywhere
		- Increase regeneration upgrade speed to make more viable
		- Silence upgrade quiets attacking and drop-from-ceiling sounds
		- Change all levels of cloaking to make you just as invisible, but each level decreases the time it takes to activate cloaking
		- Allow sensory chambers to parasite marines in sight (like a turret?).  Make it sound like a skulk parasiting you so marines don't immediately look for it (make ROF quite slow and variable so not everyone is 'sited and not regularly).  Or allow sensory chambers to cloak on their own, and cloak nearby players?!  Remove "incoming enemies" sound.
		- Verify that cloaked aliens aren't showing up on proxmity for marines (only with scan)
		- Revisit attacking while cloaked (if attack mainly does damage, it should uncloak, otherwise it shouldn't?)  Perhaps reduce energy cost for parasite so cloaked skulks can hold off one or two LMGers
		O Tone down carapace a tad
		- Add effect for when redemption kicks in (both on vanishing and reappearing...add for movement chambers also?  Make same as blink?)

		- Missing titles when spectating
		- Ladder problems

	- HLTV support
		O Add constants: #Spec_duck, #SPECT_OPTIONS, #SpecMode5Text, #OBS_MAP_FREE, #OBS_MAP_CHASE, #OBS_CHASE_FREE, #OBS_IN_EYE, #OBS_ROAMING
		O No entities are visible

		O Make icons work when spectating after death
		O Add Spect_map constant
		? Put in spectating rules on server (can't view other team, limit modes)

		? Add hive sight, motion-tracking, and alerts to spectator view
			- Get sprite drawing when third-person chase enabled
		- Don't draw view model when dead, also fade out player?
		? Add reload anims (and precise idle anims, and get clean up AvHEvents by not having to know about specific predicted weapons!)
		? Add deploy animations too!
		? Don't draw "no commander" when in observing
		? Don't target player we're observing when doing player trace

	- Rework alien upgrades and tech
		- Don't make defensive so powerful
			? Improve hive regeneration speed so def not needed (improved by 50%)
			- Counter by mobility? (one obs, phase gates, or siege)

		- Sensory changes
			? Sensory chamber cloaks all structures and players nearby, if they don't move or attack
			? When cloaked structures fire or activate, they become uncloaked.  Players can move freely while cloaked, but attacking will break it.
			? Fade structures in and out smoothly
			? Cloaked structures are essentially invisible for enemies, but faded out for friends
			? Touching or scanning a cloaked structure will uncloak it (sensory on touch)
			? Sensory chambers themselves are always cloaked 
			? Cloaking or uncloaking structures don't make sounds like cloaking/uncloaking players
			? Even cloaks the hive and resource towers!
			- Spawning players should spawn in cloaked if in range of sensory to fight spawn camping?
			- Remove "incoming enemies"
			? Don't draw rings or help text for cloaked structures

			? Change other two abilities
				? Scent of fear should detect players that are nearby
				? Enhanced sight -> Pheromones

			- Counter with observatory (or multiples), scanning, motion-tracking

		- Improve movement upgrades
			? Increase speed boost from celerity upgrade (by 40%)
			? Change silence so attacks are silent too
				? Building sounds should take it into account also
			- Maybe increase adrenaline recovery in range of movement chambers

			- Counter with higher damage, more powerful weapons

		O Remove hive requirement for higher lifeforms

	O Bringing up scoreboard moves minimap away
	? Clear spores on game reset
	? Change armory resupply code back the way it was
	? Typing "give item_health" now works right (health can be picked up by all marines, regardless of team)
	? Updated LMG model to obscure the screen less.  It has been moved down and the muzzle flash has been shrunk
	? Updated the skulk view model so it doesn't obscure the screen as much when biting.  It now bites twice as fast.
	- Fix alien-vision mode web bug (I bet it's client-side now that I think about it)
	- Fix bug where you can be redeemed and then die
	- Think about moving primal scream to lerk

	- Rules
		- Opposing tier one higher needs to have hard counter (cheaper, as easy to execute or easier)
		- Like tiers should be competitive (like skill, like points)
		- Opposing higher tiers can also enhance lower tiers to make competitive units no longer competitive (primal scream could make HMGs/siege fall, or tier-2 spores could work against scaled groups of tier-1 marines)
		- Assuming equal resources, skill and scouting, both sides should be able to get to the same tiers in the same amount of time
		- Tech tree changes: 
			O Inf portal no longer required for anything (iron man!)
			O Phase gates need research at observatory
			O Scanning needs research at observatory (same as phase?)
			- Prototype lab needs advanced armory
			O Small upgrade for deployable health required at command center
			- Each observatory capable of one scan every x seconds, once researched
			- Siege tech researched, then siege can be built at any turret factory (?)
			- Time/cost for jetpack/HA research increased to make it tier 3
			- Only advanced armory and advanced proto lab can build advanced stuff (unlike siege).  This way they can be destroyed to knock stuff out of production for awhile.
			- Hives need to be cheaper to make it easier for aliens to get them earlier, and to allow aliens a choice of build order (though maybe extra resources at start compensate)
			O Add electrical upgrade for TFs and nodes to prevent lone skulk from taking them out.
			- Increase cost of advanced armory, decrease weapons cost?
			- Healing spray should be able to corrode welds after a time
			- Think about hotkeys to make sure they work with this new model (they do)
			- Now that games are shorter, resource nodes may need to be more expensive (?)
			- ** Alien lifeforms are unchained from hives, to compensate from location-dependence of alien tech tree.  Notably, this means a tier-1 onos (though hard to get), could counter tier-2 marine tech (HMGs) and maybe be competitive with tier-3 marine tech
			- Remove blast damage on xenocide, possibly change damage, possibly change energy requirement and countdown time to make it good vs. HMGs
			- Maybe jetpacks need to slowly heal armor/health automatically to give them a chance vs. acid
			O Movement chambers give energy instead of teleport
			O Bile bomb doesn't damage players ("structural damage")...is this going to feel weird?
			O Remove spike gun
			O Change OCs to fire spikes
			- New Onos movement physics?
		- This should work for marine/marine and alien/alien too
		- Bite, parasite, leap (?), xenocide (?) (currently, skulks just get better, they don't really counter anything, though late-game zerglings do the same)
		- Spit (tweak to make more useful or interesting?  Slow enemy?), healing spray, bile bomb substitute, web
			- Bilebomb changed to be slower and non-parabolical
		- Bite2, spores (weaker, as support role), umbra, primal scream (ROF slightly, damage upgrades, all affected immediately make squealing noises)
		- Swipe, blink, hive-teleport (or teleport to blip under attack?  Rejuvenate, to get health/energy back?  Launch moth from cannon that flies attacks and distracts targets?  Ability converts health to energy <"digest", "expend", "deplete", "amplify", "heighten", "guzzle">?), acid rocket
		- Gore, Stomp, Devour, Charge
			- Devour
				O Knocks person out of combat for a bit while they're digested, though they appear again if Onos dies
				O Show "Being digested..."
				O Change sound effects while inside
				O Make screen go black, change HUD
				O Show "Devouring MonsieurEvil" with status bar
				- Progress bar is 0
				O Aiming issues
				- View model issues (wait for new view model to fix)

			- Stomp 
				- Enemies on ground within radius get view shaken hard, can't move or fire for short time

		O New research tech/icons
			? Deployable health tech (use medlab icon)
			? Phase tech (needed for both phase and scanning)
			? Electrical defense
			? Don't show upgrades that can be researched multiple times when already researched (advanced armory, advanced turret factory)
			? Don't show upgrades that can't be researched multiple times after started researching or researched

		- Animation changes:
			O Lerk: add primal scream
			- Fade: add "guzzle"
			- Onos: add devour, stomp
				- Waiting for view model

		- New sounds:
			- Primal scream adapted for lerk?
			- Bile bomb sounds changed to sound like it's dissolving structures?
			- Guzzle sound (liquidy, metabolic)
			- Devour sounds (one for attack, one for onos-killed and guy pops out, one for devour finished <burp?>)
			- Ground stomp
			- Electrical sound 

	Add damage effects to marine structures
		- Light smoking after small damage
		- Sparking with medium damage
		- Catching fire and dark smoke with heavy damage

	Roles:
		Skulk - Basic ground, scouting, versatile at later hives
		Gorge - Growth, siege, structure support (healings, welds, forward-building)
		Lerk - Combat support
		Fade - Versatile medium combat (anti-air, beats T1 marines, competitive with T2 marines, implies lowering his health/armor)
		Onos - Heavy ground

		Basic marine - Basic ground, ranged
		HMG - Heavy offense
		HA - Heavy ground
		Jetpack marine - Air, versatile
		GL - Versatile siege, visibility not needed, works better against players, no build time
		ASC - Static siege

	Resource changes:
		? Remove resource limit depending on hives
		? Every alien starts with enough resources to go gorge and then build a tower
		? Marines start with 75 resources or so (100 lets you climb too much, but is a nice round number)
		? In big games this means aliens will start with more total points, but the marines can build towers as fast as they want as well (because each tower immediately starts contributing)
		? Gorges don't get any extra resources over other players
		? Do resources from towers scale?  Perhaps not.
		Bigger games will require more gorges.  Smaller games can still accomodate more gorges.  Many gorges won't adversely affect your team, not if they can stay alive.

	- Move commander UI to tech slot model
		? Integrate basic code and get hotkeys working again
		? Added new research (electrical, phasegate tech, health)
		? Distinction between available and enough points (calculate points on client?)
		? Handle menus properly
		? Add highlighting for current menu and when hotkey hit
		? Set menu default when entering and leaving CC
		- Fix recycle icon
			- Show recycle progress indicator?
		- Fix research problem with siege and health (keep researching)
		- Send current menu to server for spectating/replays?
		- Fix "jump to alert"
		- Commander hotgroups!
			? Basic system
			? Remove buildings and players when destroyed or leaving team
			? Get number drawing on icons
				- Needs to be nicer looking
			- Fix problem where one marine selected won't let menu change
			- Hitting jump should go to last alert, including pending requests (and should remove the request normally)
			? Add config binds for idle soldiers and requests
			? Change hotgroups to draw proper icon for group
			? Refactor highlighting
			- Add visual way to create hotgroups?
				- Draw hotgroups even when not created?
			- Draw hotgroups when under attack
			? Send sound to players added to squad
			? Draw visual squad indicator for soldiers
			? Make groups function properly when players in groups leave server or switch teams

	O Draw tournament mode timer to scoreboard, not to general HUD, draw it even without tourny mode?
	? Change commander name so you can read it
	- Draw number of nodes that team has (draw info for both teams when spectating).  Draw shadows showing which nodes were last seen to be controlled by enemy. (or more simply, just draw +x which is how much was received last tick?)

	? Fix jump to go to alerts
	? Change config from selectall to impulse
	- Marine resource tower rings

	x Change paralyze sprite -> stomp
	x Change babbler sprite -> devour
	? Onos too slow
	? Don't change self with alternate vision mode
	? Have to aim down to devour
	? Show progress bar for devour
	O Change view model for devour, don't allow it to fire again while digesting
	- Make sure mp_uplink is getting set to 1 every tick
	- Some tech node label is visible in ready room

	- Change observatories and distress beacon to have energy 
		? Work for generic system
		? When not having enough energy, the tech node should show as red, not disabled
		- Prereq text not printing when energy showing
		- Energy doesn't show when full
	O Decreased time needed to start respawning after death (make sure it works with death anims)
	O Spit ROF and damage increased noticeably (overall power roughly doubled)
	O Tweaked weapon and ammo weights (promote non-HA use of heavy weapons, promote shotgun as point, make marine weapons feel more responsive)
	O Added option to disable flashing effects for photosensitive players
	O Messages from server always show up, even if tooltips are off (voting messages, adminmod messages, etc.).  Turning off tooltips no longer disables help icons.
	- Make announcement when ready to start soliciting veterans (put up demo FTP also)
		- My basic strategy will be to hang out in #nsscrim and watch games.  Sometimes I'll watch demos also, but mostly I'm interested in seeing clans that do the following:
			- Scrim multiple times per week
			- Can get along well with the other clans, and can talk about balance, strategy, etc. while remaining pleasant and respectful
			- Will continually try new strategies and try to "break" the balance
			- Can compete with the other top clans that are selected

	- Round reset problems
		- Jobabob's analysis: http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=4&t=24222

	- Welding changes
		? Make them reset properly every time
		- Only take damage from the right things (healing spray)
		- Really think about their role

	O Alien turret changes
		O They shoot spikes intead of spit
		O Their idle animations play without hitching (3 different idles)
		O They play take damage animations also
		O Show spike sprite when projectile hits it

	- Lerk physics changes
		- Try flying in whatever direction you're looking
		? Lerks no longer take falling damage

	- Korean push
		- Find someone to translate (asked Jason Robar)
		- Anything other usability in SC/War III NS is missing?

	Time line:
		Game start	->	Marine Tier 0, Alien Tier 1
		~30 seconds ->	Marine Tier 1
		~1 minute	->	Advanced Tier 1
		4 minutes	->	Tier 2
		~5 minutes	->	Advanced Tier 2
		8 minutes	->	Tier 3
		~9 minutes	->	Advanced Tier 3

	- Marine Tier 0
		- LMG, pistol, knife, without capability for more extra ammo
	- Alien Tier 0
		- Bite, spit
			
	- Marine Tier 1
		- Deployable ammo
		Advanced -> mines, sentries, deployable health, distress beacon, resource towers, welder/welding, shotguns, Siege cannons
	- Alien Tier 1
		- Parasite, healing spray
		Advanced -> Offensive chambers, spikes, spores, sensory/movement/defensive upgrades, resource towers, blink, onos-1

		Analysis: 
			mines > rush (competitive with fades)
			If enough money is pumped in: 
				onos > sentries, deployable ammo/health > OCs
				shotties > skulks/gorges
				siege > sentries/OCs
				onos > LMGs
			lerks competitive with shotties (> in defense role)
			mines competitive with fades, onos
			alien upgrades allow aliens to become more powerful for cash, just like shotties/mines/welders
			welder competitive with healing spray
			Gorge have ability to remove welds (takes the same time as welding, allow it to be welded back and forth?)
			Massed spores should beat armory-teching marines, but should fall once advanced weapons arrive

	- Marine Tier 2
		- Level 1 ammo/armor
		Advanced -> HMGs, GLs, motion-tracking, phase gates (with new prerequisite upgrade), scanning (if upgrade added), armor/ammo upgrades
	- Alien Tier 2
		- Leap, gorge bile bomb
		Advanced -> Umbra, fade ability, second set of upgrades 

		Analysis: 
			Tier 3 GLs beat umbra
			Marines get scanning to counter hive-1 sensory
			Marines get siege to counter hive-1 defense
			Motion-tracking or phase gates vs movement chambers (vs. silence and celerity)
			Bilebomb beats sentries
			HMGs counter tier 1 skulks/gorges, competitive with tier 2 lerks and fades (umbra, esp. with def chambers/regen)
			Umbra/skulks beats LMGs, sentries
			Scanning beats Alien Tier 1 (current sYn tactic)
			Leap vs. ?
			Tier 2 onos competitive with 

	- Marine Tier 3
		- Level 2 ammo/armor
		Advanced -> Heavy armor, jetpacks, level 3 ammo/armor
	- Alien Tier 3
		- Xenocide, web
		Advanced -> primal scream, acid rocket, third set of upgrades

		Analysis:
			Webs strong vs. jetpacks (though hard to use in practice with vulnerable gorge on frontlines)
			Jetpacks counter onos (make sure devour only works if player is on ground?)
			Onos beat HA/HMG (with charge)
			GL beats umbra
			Acid rocket strong vs. jetpacks, and JP/HMG (though a little more expensive)
			Acid rocket beats tier-2 HMG
			Tier-3 HA/HMG should beat acid rocket (but not hard counter, implies reduction in acid damage and increase in splash radius)
			Level 3 ammo/armor upgrades competitive with fades (esp. at marine spawn)
			Primal scream helps beat tier 2 marines
			Leap-Xenocide vs. HMG/GLs (esp. with cost)
			* Make gorges slightly more costly or take longer to morph to, so losing gorges is still bad, and going all gorge is risky (in light of new resource model changes)
			Problem: alien team will generally have all lifeforms, because it doesn't cost anything to explore a technology.  This means fades/onos will always be present at tier 3.  Fix this by making alien lifeforms initially more expensive and then cheaper as they continue to be evolved to?  Or first cost and then cost after that?  Say, 80 for first onos, then 50 after that?  Or one cost if there exists none of that lifeform, and another if there are multiples?  Cheaper and cheaper?

	? Resource nodes now run out
		? They give alerts when nearly empty
			- They need to always show, even when visible and not within range?
		? They stomp making sounds and pumping when they are empty
		? Takes 10 minutes to run out, resources harvest evenly no matter the team size, they also show accurate non-float numbers when harvesting (unless handicap is activated)

	O Added volunteer handicap for teams in tourny mode.  Removed team size handicapping now (team limit enforcement is enough).

	- Alien menu improvements
		- Show cost for OC, Hive, resource tower, upgrade chambers
		- Show disabled nodes (esp. upgrades) more clearly
			- Make invalid nodes obvious without moving to them
		- Move tooltip back near mouse?
		O Make chooseable nodes clear (upgrade nodes aren't obvious)
			O Rework nodes to do so
		- Add changing cursor for all valid end nodes
			O Added lifeforms change
			O Added marine change (need new cursor though?)
			- Change cursor for other alien options (get artwork from Relic)

		- Remove or rework alien comms
			- Draw chatting/status alien blips even if not pointing at them?
		- Remove ready room off pop-up for both sides
		- Allow cancelling of morphs?
		- Unify marine and alien upgrades by drawing at the same place if possible

	- Allow server to csay without autohelp enabled (http://www.natural-selection.org/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=5&t=23194)
	- Force "hive construction complete" sound
	- Low-resolution support (weapon sprites, theme.txt)?
	? Make sure advanced turret factory can be recycled
	O Relaxed gestation requirements to avoid annoying "you must be on ground to gestate" errors
	O Scent of Fear now shows nearby enemies, not nearby damaged enemies

	- Make sure to show build rings for structures on mouseover 
	- Change leap to not hurt buildings?

	- Move PT auth icon status "above" guide icon status
	- Move auth system after mp_authicons is loaded from .cfg 
	? Offense chamber hurting themselves in tourny mode
	- Fix or rework blink
	- Go through NS Bugs mail folder and fix as many of those as possible
	O Resource tower "targetOnBuild" only fires once now
	- Remove info_location z-checking.  Remove info_locations from map after loaded to reduce entity count (make sure map reset still works)
	- Add client-side temp grenade for grenade launcher
	- Display message when cheats are enabled
	- Include cheating death icon from prodigy, add auth mask as well
	- Leap exploit: when binding leap impulse with two hives (energy must be decremented in AvHPlayer::ExecuteMessage instead of weapon::DeductCostForShot

	O Integrate new tech icons
		O Use red frame for structure under attack
		O Use red frame for not enough cash

	- Armory exploit:
		From Swirl, via forum PM: "When a marine stands next to an armoury and presses his use key to get ammo, its quite slow getting ammo, but when you press your use key + flashlight repetitively, the speed that you gain ammo at is incredibly fast. I dont know if you know about this, and I hope you will fix it for 1.1 . Ill send you a demo of this if my explanation is a bit vague"

	O Collision fixes
    	O func_resources still jitter
		O Resource nodes don't lie flush
		X Turret factory could be wider
		O Observatory and resource tower and alien resource tower cause jitters
		O Hives aren't the right size? (getting stuck when spawning)
		X Alien resource tower not tall enough
		X Still crouch/jittering when holding duck on certain sides of buildings (regardless of facing)

	- Easier learning curve
		- Perfect world: there's a full single-player campaign that teaches all the basic mechanics...but this doesn't solve the strategy part
		- Simple SP level that gets player to learn the very basics, then
			- queries n-s.org for list of training servers, and asks the user if they would like to connect one of them (it would need a certain number of players with x status and have a ping of y or less)
			- gets them to configure their mic first, if at all possible (Steam, or add voice control myself and set sv_loopback for a moment)
			- get training servers by all servers running special training maps (nst_?) or get sponsored servers and allow player to choose one
			- add GUI for trainers to let them easily run things 
				- Turn on/off damage for players, reset the game, enable alltalk, allow them to spectate first-person for a player, build a structure anywhere, mute players temporarily so they have the floor
				- Allow players to report abuse
				- Allow trainers to move players between teams (put all this on the scoreboard?)
				- Only allow trainers that have been authenticated as such
				- Add features that encourage players to add others as friends when playing on Steam
				- Allow trainers to signal for more trainers
				- Allow trainers to take control of other players (hard for commanding though)

	- Remove/disable thirdperson commands (from Tau hang10)
		cam_command 1
		cam_idealyaw 0
		then do a retry to the server
		im pretty sure this is client side only

	? Physics exploits
		? Bunnyhopping (from iwa.plex)
			- sv_airaccelerate 0
			- sv_airmove 0

		? ex_ exploits:

			- ex_interp 0.01

		- Same with delta?

	O Lerks no longer take falling damage
	- Logging stuff
		- Commander-wins
		- Time research finished ("time to arms lab", "time to HA")
		- 

	O Add option to disable flashing effects for epileptic players (cl_photosensitive)
	O Changed FOV for different aliens for immersion.  Added checkbox for forcing default FOV (cl_forcedefaultfov).
		? Migrate FOV code back in
		- Put check in for software rendering too, or if usedefaultfov is checked
	O Added extra flavor animations to alien resource tower
	O Fixed problems where marine and alien resource towers weren't animating smoothly
	- Change spectator name color from black

	? Added authentication system for registered users, playtesters
		O Implement basic system
		- Get Joev to add a special user-name password for it in the protectdl section so it can be monitored
		- Ask Joev about what path to use for IP instead of using DNS
		- Ask Joev if this is secure or if user/password will be obvious to people
		- Look into getting a security certificate and using ssl
		- Look into financial backend on n-s.org
		joev: PK is an 'id' but auto incremented (better for MNySQL to optimize indexes that way)
		joev: here's the schema: 
		Flayra: Great, I was just thinking wonid would be a crappy id
		joev: int id, char name, bigint wonid, int rank, smallint authorized.
		joev: the 'auth' table is then joined on the rank field with the rankings table which is: 
		Flayra: Great.  The rank is just a bitmask in the code right now (used for drawing the icon), so a player can have multiple ranks (dev, pt, etc.)
		joev: int id, char ranktitle.
		joev: yes.. but as I say, if you make your code stop looking when it hits the wonid, then the player get's the icon of the highest rank for that wonid :)
		Flayra: Sounds great, though I don't know enough about dbs that I know why you'd join the two instead of putting all that info into one table
		Flayra: Well I have to download the whole file so it won't matter when I stop looking
		Flayra: (and I'm splitting the whole thing up when I first fetch it)
		joev: the why is this: easier to add ranks without munging up the setup :)
		Flayra: Rocking, you know bizest

	- Install and configure ArticleManager
		- Write honest review for Fraser: fraser@interactivetools.com

	- CAL support
		? Team score shows number of resources accumulated (show for both teams to start, remove if not cool)
		? Show marine kills/deaths in tourny mode
		? mp_timelimit in tournymode shows countdown for everyone and ends the game afterwards (looking at team resources when setting the victory condition)
		- Add support for draw game
		- Make timelimit blink red when almost done
		- Don't display team resources for enemy team
		- Log game end specially (score)

	- Enhanced demo playback
		- Particles

			- Spawn particles aren't oriented towards viewer, probably because of vofs crap
		- Building health circles
		O Gamma

		- Remedy -> Max Payne (www.remedy.fi)
		O http://www.dperry.com/ -> Lots of UK listings

	O Rework commander hotkeys so they're hardcoded but work well
		- Menu is now 4x3 (new category for orders, 4 rows no longer needed with new armory/equipment model)
			- Get artwork scaled (maybe I can do this) and tweak values so it looks right
			O Add new category
		O QWER, ASDF, ZXCV match up to menu intuitively
		O Added customization support in advanced config

	- Armory changes
		- Put equipment into production
			- Research shotty production, HMG production, GL production
			- Each armory slowly creates a weapon of that type in range every 20-30 seconds (up to three weapons around each structure?)
			- Same goes for the prototype lab (jetpacks and HA)
			! Don't forget to always propagate entities to commander if they are selected

		- Advantages
			- Frees up room on the UI for new hotkey system
			- Less commander frustration
			- No more whining about "HMG/HA plz"
			- Means multiple armories and prototype labs are useful (as well as specialized bases)
			- Means heavy weapons are more viable without super high costs
			- Means armories might be targetted
			- Perhaps an appropriate advantage against new faster growing aliens
			- Binds technology to an area ("shotties at sewer" or "grenades outside refinery")
			- Consistent with high-level duties, scales well to games of all sizes

		- Disadvantages
			- Commander can't reward individual players easily
			X Pain to implement
			- Fundamental balance change

	- If marines have no arms lab, they lose those upgrades as well (make arms lab a bit tougher probably)

	- Drowning bug/exploit (healthbug.dem, from Comprox)

	- Commander building exploit (e-mail from Mike Hodgkinson)
		- One of regulars found an exploit which could be used on NS as commander where he could build structures while in the commandchair.
		- I saw hi doing this on ns_missilecommand_final3, it looked like the structure was being built by no one.
		- He told me how to do it, you centre your view over the structure and hold "use", builds just as fast as if a marine was building it. This makes sense as I understand thier is a commghost entity. Im thinking of disabling comms from being able to press thier "use" while they are in the commchair with a metamod plugin, but I thought it may be important to advise you of.

I finally had the exit the game completely and go back in.
	- Voogru: I dont know if you know about this or not but the advanced armory doesnt show the health becuase the fuser2  on the armory is reset to 0. I fixed this by simply doing this:pEntity->v.fuser2 = pEntity->v.health/2.4;I know it probally will be different with how you have it setup but i think its becuase of the fuser2 getting reset.Just trying to help out.-voogru(BTW, your PM box is full!)

- Pop-up menu is drawing lines on top of textured connectors (actually, GL is doing this too I believe maybe just more obvious in D3D somehow?)

---------------------
- XP approach to NS -
---------------------
- Get value from code ASAP
	- Does this mean open beta, now?  No, not quite, but close.  I don't want a situation where people don't see what the game is trying to do, or where there are so many vocal dissidents that it ruins it for others.  Missing crucial features could be considered bugs, and I'm wasting people's time by giving them buggy software.
	- But still, get value ASAP.  There is a value in people spreading the word and seeing what the game will be soon.  What's different about after release then the day before the release?  How about the day before that?  Where do you draw the line?  Why choose to draw the line so late, when people obviously want to see bits of it now?
	- So, show it to people as soon as it's fun and as soon as it's representative of the final product.  Representative means, representative of the gameplay and quality of the final product.  This means it can't be full of bugs, and the gameplay must at least be similar, though not necessarily as full-realized, as the final product.
	- When is this?
		- Missing map areas are fine, so long as the map is representative of it's final state
		- Missing weapons are fine
		- Bad artwork isn't great
		- Missing systems that are crucial to the gameplay are not
		- The systems that are required are the alien buildings, the builder, the bacterial stream, resource towers, basic alien abilities

- Alien building technology
	- Base resource model
		- Hives accumulate resources over time, then split them up among all alive alien players every so often
		- Resource nodes acquire resources directly into the hive.  They are built by the level 2 aliens.
		- After a team has harvested x resources, a new hive is built.  After x more resources, another hive is built.  If no resource nodes are built, the amount of
		time it will take for each new hive to come online is around 8 minutes.
		- Resources are not given to either team by kills.  Kills still go on the scoreboard for alien players.

	- Builders (level 2 aliens)
		- Builder aliens can shoot a short ranged projectile, build resource nodes, upgrade resource nodes, build evolutionary sacs and build static defenses.
		- Builders can hold their use key to project the bacterial stream onto a target building or creature.  This builds or heals a building, and builds or heals a player.
		It could also speed up evolution into a new lifeform.
		- Multiple builders can work on the same player/building to speed up the process
		- Buildings can only be placed within sight and range of another building.  If at any time, a building's link to the source of the bacterial stream, the building
		will cease to function.  The exceptions to this rule are hives and resource towers, which generate the bacterial stream.
		- The current upgrade system goes away (where each alien purchases his own upgrades).  This is done to ensure technology coherence in the alien team, for more strategy.
		- Buildings include:
			- Resource node (which can be upgraded multiple times by a builder)
			- "Plant" turret (fairly weak)
			- Four different evolutionary sacs (currently cloaking, regeneration, speed, armor).  
			- Multiple buildings (up to three of each type) can be built to provide a new level of ability.  For example:
				- 1 cloaking sac built - All aliens get current cloaking ability
				- 2 cloaking sacs built - All aliens can cloak, but also remain cloaked while moving
				- 3 cloaking sacs built - All aliens remain cloaked at all times, even when moving and firing
				- 4 cloaking sacs built - No additional abilities (but if one sac is destroyed, the aliens still have 3 so they don't suffer any reduced ability)
			- Some type of heavy defense (gas turret?)

	- Alien respawning
		- Egg laying is gone.  No one understood this and it doesn't make much sense anyways.
		- A hive gives birth every 8 seconds or so.  It gives birth to the player that has been been out of play the longest (including late-joiners).  When a hive
		is in the process of giving birth, it plays a special animation.  Recently birthed players appear next to the hive as a level 1 alien.
		- If the game hasn't started, or the game time just started, the birthing time is only one second.
		- Any alien near a hive becomes linked to the bacterial stream and regenerates (maybe visual, maybe not)

	- Ammo for aliens
		- All aliens have an "energy" bar that starts out full.  When using most of their weapons or abilities, this bar goes down.  Weapons or abilities can 
		only be used if the alien has enough energy.
		- At any time, an alien player can pay a flat point cost to refill his energy bar.  There is no way to get energy back for "free".  Maybe this can
		only be done when the alien is accessible by the bacterial stream?

	- Unlocking abilities
		- There are exactly three hive locations per map.
		- The level 1 and level 2 lifeforms are always available.  
			- The level 3 lifeform is only available when the alien team has at least one active hive.
			- The level 4 lifeform is only available when the alien team has at least two active hives.
			- The level 5 lifeform is only available when the alien team has at least three active hives.
		- All alien weapons and abilities are listed in the weapon groups (1-5), ala standard Half-life
		- All passive movement abilities are always available
		- The weapons and abilities in category 1 are always available
			- The weapons and abilities in category 2 are only available when the alien team has at least one active hive
			- The weapons and abilities in category 3 are only available when the alien team has at least two active hives
			- The weapons and abilities in category 4 are only available when the alien team has at least three active hives
			- There probably won't be any weapons and abilities in category 5 for now, but if they are added later, they will likely be linked up to the "alpha male".
			- The alien player with the highest score is the "alpha male" and gets access to his category 5 weapons and abilities as a bonus!
	
	- Ramifications	
		- This means can grow quickly by building resource nodes and can "tech up" by at the expense of other upgrades, static defenses, and some offense.  It also
		means that if no aliens want to be builders, new hives will still grow.
		- This also means that builder aliens can heal turrets, hives, players or other buildings while they are being attacked, enriching their support role.  It also
		means they could function effectively near the front line.
		- The energy bar means aliens will always be trying to optimize their weapon and ability usage.  It also limits abuse of webs, leaping, etc.  A great player
		could continue to optimize his usage of energy, pushing for an earlier lifeform upgrade.
		- Strategic strikes against hives or specific upgrade buildings could change all aliens capabilities immediately.  A alien "supply line" could also be attacked,
		by attacking a structure in the middle of a chain.  Aliens could also build redundant bacterial links to prevent this.
		- New hives are the key to radical new tech and lifeforms.  Keeping the hives under control will be an immediate priority for the enemy.

- New alien weapons and abilities
	O Implement unlocking of abilities with new hives 3/9
	- Create resource buildings on func_resource
	- Create plant turrets
	- Design alien ammo/energy (and draw on HUD) (allow "reloading", but it costs points to refill, promotes waiting until almost empty, also promotes minimal use of firepower to get the job done)
	- Draw alien membrane scaled
	- Alien weapons and abilities
		- An alien gun that fires both when you press the button and also when you release
		- A tongue-spike that goes through walls and floors
		- A spike gun that fires multiple spikes at once, at slightly different angles (around 30 degrees difference) (good players could hit multiple targets)
		- A grenade-type weapon that inherits your velocity and also your angular velocity, so you can spin and whip it up onto balconies
		- An alien gun that fires as fast as you can press the trigger
		- A gun that charges, Melnorme style (it blocks whatever hits it, it grows bigger the longer you hold down, it is shot when released, it does more damage the bigger it is).  It only recharges when you don't have it held down, always takes same amount of energy to start.  Great vs. turrets!
		- Dark swarm that blocks all visibility and turret fire!
		- Phasing/teleport for level 4
		- Ollying ability for level 4

- Alien resource model
	- First real system: building a structure or making a kill increased score by 1.  When resources are allocated, it is done proportionally by score, but with a minimum of 1 share per person.
	- Show point costs for each icon
	- Display current points
	- Kills from structures increase score as well.  If a structure dies, the player that built it loses a point off their score.  This means players will want to protect their own structures.  Other players will want to also, because the loss of it means loss of a personal upgrade or future points.
	- Loss of a structure removes the upgrade that the aliens have the most of.  Ie, if 3 aliens have pull back and armor, and 2 have pullback and regen, pullback will be removed first.  If this can't be removed from a player, a random upgrade from that player is removed.  This means the largest possible cohesive effect will be seen when structures are destroyed (suddenly, there are no cloakers, ie, the upgrade that was most "successful" and prominent)
	- This means that builders won't build structures in dumb places, it would cost them
	- Draw score on the UI somehow.  When a player has the highest score on their team, they should get a special designation (glistening?).  Maybe something for 2nd place also?
	- When hive can spawn someone in, it spawns person with the highest score.  Spawning doesn't cost resources, except those lost on lifeform, which makes killing level 1s somewhat pointless.

O Fixup grenade launcher (aiming is broken)

- Fix up overwatch so it's not so accurate and deadly

- <test at Iron Lore here>

- Menu screen that lets you go back to the ready room (or otherwise switch teams)
	- Do voting and other admin stuff from here?

- Add ability to fire turrets by issuing them an order (!)

- Software mode issues
	- Crashing
	- Try to decide if we want to support it

- Fog of war?

- Ability to hotkey buildings

- Commander abilities
	- Stim pack
	- Teleport
	- Shoulder cannons

- Commander selection issues
	- Make it easier to give attack-enemy orders (bounding spheres?)
	- Highlight buildings to make easier to see for commander and players

- Recoil and/or overheating
	- Firing through walls with upgrades (maybe allow different depths according to upgrade?)
	- Allow for aliens as well

- Polish and improve waypoints

- Experiment with using gamma
	- Flash red when you're hit
	- Green alien vision?

- <test at Adrenaline Zone here?>

Linux tar
---------
Make tar:
tar zcvf tarball.tar.gz . 

Unzip and untar:
tar -xzvf tarball.tar.gz


----------------------------
- Particle system features -
----------------------------
- Allow editing of multiple particle systems with the same name (affect them all)
- Add customizable gravity (for acceleration effect)
- Add trigger that's fired when a particle collides

Design ways for marines to participate with relying too heavily on combat (healing, building, ammo running, scouting, gate maintenance, etc.)
	Scouting for marines:
	  By product of a few rules
	  - Move faster without weapons/armor
	  - Purchase a HUD enhancement (scanner) that remembers the last position for an alien that was viewed

Tourny quality:
	- "Games need no configurable options. No obscure console based network settings and the like, just the game controls, a brightness slider and a 
	connection selecter. I think this should be a high priority in the next cpl game." 
	- These game options could be stored at a URL.  Tourny mode makes it easy for people to sit down in front of machine, type their URL to download their base settings, then tweak their mouse sensitivy, gamma, monitor and stuff.  Make this part of the ready room?!
	- Allow calling of time-outs.  Screen goes black, all chat becomes team-only.  Show countdown (configurable time).  Each team can call x timeouts per y rounds.  Only commander can call time-out, he does it in-game, it happens before the next round.
	- Tournament mode where an administrator can view through anyone's eyes, record demo, pause the game, check people's configs remotely.  The best part would be if a player crashes, he could pause the game and wait for the person to reboot, reconnect and get back in, with same resources and everything, mid-game
	- Have a tweaking map where everyone can run around and easily change their mouse sensitivity, try either side, set their binds, have access to all upgrades and abilities.  From here, the game should be able to be started on any map by the admin (they walk through door indicating they are ready to play) (maybe just ability for admin to give RUs, upgrades and lifeform to any player while paused)
	- Disallow console access in tourny mode once game has started.  Checking .cfgs is one thing, but people will change it when the admin leaves!

Actively think of ways the marine players will feel closer to each other after a game
- Importance of repair role
- The feeling that you know you're going to die if a person near you dies, or doesn't do something well
- Gestures, communication, expressiveness.  
  - This is the hardest part but potentially the most rewarding one.  Prevent that feeling of frustration you have when you feel you just can't do or express what you want to do in other games.  Doesn't happen as much in RTS, mostly FPS where the action is frantic and you have a persona (?).
  - Custom skins, configurable sayings?  Ie, text to speech or custom chat sayings?

Develop musical theme that is common throughout game (ala eXistenZ or Gladiator) (it should be the same theme for aliens and humans)
- "Blizzard's music wizards Jason Hayes (sound lead on new unannounced, did zerg voices, protoss music I think, 318 984-7772), Glenn Stafford (War III) and Matt Uelman"

-Angelus in medio ignis By Eric Serra. 
(Great Choir work, done for the movie "the messenger") 
-The good o'll "Panzerlied" 
(Gets me all the time)  
- Aria - 'Oceania, 'Tis for Thee' by Dominic Muldowney 
(Sounds a bit like the Soviet party Hymn songs, and therefore it sounds great)

Marines ability to fire depends on time spent looking in that direction (promotes alien flanking behavior, discourages marine DM behavior)...a bit unnatural though

When a player disconnects from the server, have the model fade away slowly mid-action and play a phasing sound (or he walks back to base and disappears into spawn point area?).  Give some points back to the commander (half of what he's worth?)

Report in - Updates marine's position with rest of teammates (like Aliens' HUD but is manual and not as up to date)
  "Reporting in" - moving
  "In position" - still
  "Sarge!", "Help!" or "AIghghg!!" - being attacked
  Marines only hear members in their own squad, and all superiors report in (though they still get update on HUD)
  All communication and chat updates position as well
  Any marine in view is automatically updated continuously, and for a few seconds after leaving sight

Use text to speech capabilities for prototyping all comms

Draw chat text on top of player via bubble to show who just said it

Design marine training camp
	- Human instructors
	- Safe metagame
	- Shooting range
	- Give instructor full power for upgrades
	- Place to try out jetpack jumping
	- Area to be damaged slowly, surely
	- Demonstrate what commander does (instructor becomes commander, everyone gets his view)
	- Show what it's like for an alien to walk into an overwatched marine (put player into alien costume, he walks around corner...immersive ricocheting sounds, damage feedback)
	- Military playground with buttons, elevators, glass, fans, etc
	- No human can be damaged (except in danger area to test out lifesupport, healing/repair)
	- Give instructor ability to transport others to server he goes to (they follow him)
	- Check psychology references to see what kinds of environments people learn best in (no fear of failure, safe, clear source of direction)
	- Drill Sargent: "What, you only got 50% accuracy with the AWP? That just earned you 300 pushups and 20 laps around the base, SOLDIER!" 
	- Allow stats in the training mode.
	- Make training camp useful for newbies, but also a way that clans could practice

Design one-click play
	- Starts game on clean, safe spaceship
	- Access computers to train (on other server) or embark on a voyage (play).  Ping isn't nearly as important for training, so query for list of training servers from master and return an appropriate one automatically and quickly?

Figure out a way for the aliens to cut the power ("What do you mean, THEY cut the power?")

Alien base labrinth
	- Multiple entrances and exits in a big mound of carbon stuff
	- The base model has multiple doors and expansion nodes have names, link doors to these named expansion nodes, nydus style
	- Means an alien can build one, then immediately receive reinforcements.  Remove warp gate?  Allow warp gate to be shot through?!! (big advantage for projectile-based marines)

After first release:
  - Have an official map of the week/month.  Post it super-prominently on the front page and it gives incentive for people to 
  submit maps and put new ones in the rotation

Extra features to investigate
- Ability for the commander to call a time-out between rounds
- Subliminal images of the aliens when they are near by (flash an image for a microsecond!)
- Show tournament mode or casual mode in ready room
- Add "Awaiting orders" or "Require assistance" and have them blink for commander's attention (hit space to go to)
- When a player takes damage, play a "We're under attack" message, allow space to go to it

When shipping:
- Write Agent-Hunter for German mirror (www.blackmesa.de, agent@blackmesa.de)
- Write ArsTechnica for followup
- Write "excel", Joe Hoseman, of InVision Interactive 2 weeks before releasing first version of NS, he'll help out (InVision Interactive)
- Write Bill Dugan at Sierra: Bill.Dugan@Sierra.com (tell him that it's released)
- E-mail Max McGill telling him when the game is released
- Write Tom Chick
